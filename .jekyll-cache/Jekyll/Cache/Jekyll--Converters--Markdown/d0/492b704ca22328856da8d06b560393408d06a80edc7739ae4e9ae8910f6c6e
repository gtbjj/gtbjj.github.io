<h4 id="dealing-with-rain">Dealing with Rain:</h4>

<p>This might seem like a silly talking point, but it’s something I’ve been harshly reminded of this weekend. After an unusually long summer in 2015, the fall of 2016 here in the Southeast U.S. has unusually (and wonderfully) 
cool and dry.</p>

<p>Now, that has come with some problems (e.g. wild fires and 
consequent fire bans in nearly all North Georgia / 
Tennessee camping areas), but it has meant early prime 
climbing conditions.</p>

<p>At any rate this past weekend has brought much needed rain and conditions 
more typical of early winter in Georgia.  Which means utterly disgusting 
camping conditions to the cadence of 40’ and constant drizzling rain. Yuck!</p>

<p>The weather spoiled me early on, but now I’m reminded how winter is going 
to bring it’s own set of difficulties compared to summer.</p>

<h4 id="too-easy">Too Easy:</h4>

<p>I’ve actually been holding out on this post / section topic for a while.<br />
In fact, I was hoping to headline some click bate to the tune of <em>“2 
grades in 2 months”</em>, but alas I’m grateful that the process of my current 
project(s) get to continue a bit longer (see image above).</p>

<p>Much of my climbing training (cragwise) is dictated by season.  Not 
uncommonly, late fall to early spring is for crushing and pushing your 
limits hard while the warmer months are for filling in volume.  That said, 
I also keep detailed training notes so I’m, hopefully, able to 
identify and address training needs.  (see” <a href="http://www.climbstrong.com/articles/20150313">Quantifying 
Bouldering Sessions</a>” and “<a href="http://www.climbstrong.com/articles/20140304">The Value of a Training Log</a>”).</p>

<p>Coming through the summer of “<a href="http://www.climbstrong.com/articles/20150724">Going 
Medium</a>”, I realized I was 
going <em>too easy</em> both in the gym and at the crag.  Rather than working 
hard in the 75 - 80% (of your max problem) zone, I was probably closer to 
50%.  In other words, I was just sweating and getting tired.</p>

<p>I was also feeling pretty flat and a bit frustrated by how long I’d been 
in the V5 range.  However, it finally hit home for me that the reason I 
hadn’t ticked a V6 yet (at that time) was because I hadn’t tried enough of 
them.  I could literally count the number of attempts I’d put in on 
problems V6 and up on two hands.  Compare that to long standing projects 
(for anybody) that involve maybe a dozen attempts on each of a dozen days 
or more per year maybe for years on end.</p>

<p>Sometimes you just need to drop the clutch and really <a href="http://www.angiepayne.com/new-blog/2014/5/relearning-to-try-hard">try 
hard</a>, and sometimes you need to <a href="http://www.stevemaischtraining.com/on-becoming-self-aware-the-r-measure-and-you.html">know when to shift gears</a>.</p>

<h5 id="nutrition">Nutrition:</h5>

<p>I’m going to avoid the obvious flame war (e.g. Paleo vs. Vegan vs. 
anything else) and speak from personal experience.  In short, I’ve been a 
lifelong athlete and since the dawn of my climbing career I’ve enjoyed 
having avoided getting on a scale for the past three years. That is after 
the bulk of my competitive athletics being weight class based sports.</p>

<p>At any rate, I’d previously excused my weight for good reason.  I was 
developing a much more healthy relationship with food and focusing on 
climbing specific training – having already developed a “good enough” 
athletic / physique base.</p>

<p>The details of my current regimine could warrant a post of their own, but 
I’ll summarize by saying that it is a personalization of Tim Ferriss’s 
<em><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Hour-Body-Uncommon-Incredible-Superhuman/dp/030746363X/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1480869452&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=4+hour+body">The 4 Hour Body</a></em>.  The point I want to drive home though is that I couldn’t ignore my weight 
anymore.  Over the summer I ignored weight gain under the 
guise of getting stronger.  But an honest look at the muffin top creeping 
over my harness put things in perspective.</p>

<p>I know that my peak fitness (below - at the very beginning of my climbing 
career, hot off the competitive Jiu Jitsu circuit) level is about 167 lbs 
which leaves me at about 6-7% body fat.</p>

<p><img style="height: auto; width: 50%; float: left" src="https://drive.google.com/uc?id=0B2RH_BSaD6YPRGxUM3YtRlo0WVk" /></p>

<p><img style="height: auto; width: 50%; float right" src="https://drive.google.com/uc?id=0B2RH_BSaD6YPUllhcTI0d2tUZ3c" /></p>

<p>That certainly isn’t sustainable year-round.  What it is is a literal peak 
that I can only sustain for about 6 weks.  However, not so different from 
other sports, staying within about 5% of that “optimum / ideal weight” 
year-round is both attainable and beneficial to performance.  In my case, 
that leaves me at a goal of ~175 lbs. Which is where I feel good, look 
good, perform well, and am just outside the point of diminishing returns.</p>
