I"¥<p>Recently Iâ€™ve been working my way back from a system 
restoration and getting into the swing of things.  I 
maintain a few packages in the Arch User Repository 
(<a href="https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/?O=0&amp;SeB=m&amp;K=gtbjj&amp;outdated=&amp;SB=n&amp;SO=a&amp;PP=50&amp;do_Search=Go">list</a>) 
and run into a slight issue that, forturnately only took a 
bit of time but nothing too complicated to fix.</p>
