I"s<p>After discovering that someone has started and <a href="https://bbs.archlinux.org/viewtopic.php?id=211400">Arch Forum thread for this machine</a>, I was prompted with this issue.  I use keyboard shortcuts to suspend and lock this laptop alreay.  I usually just hit the hotkey(s), close the lid, and never think twice about it (the solution Iâ€™m suggesting here).</p>
