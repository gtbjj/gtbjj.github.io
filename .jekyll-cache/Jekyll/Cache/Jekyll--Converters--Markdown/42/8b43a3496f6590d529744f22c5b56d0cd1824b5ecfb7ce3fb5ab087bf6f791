I"><p>Within the Paleo / Keto / Carnivore circles, thereâ€™s a bit of controversy about dairy.  It is an animal product (carnivore), but not a paleolithic (pre-domesticated cattle) product.  Yet, many forms of dairy are very popular on ketogenic diets due to their (sometimes) low carb and high fat / protein nature.</p>
