Some kernel versions boot properly, the performance profiles are not applied approrpiately and sometimes lead to overheating issues.  Please stay tuned while I work on the issues over the weekend.  Thanks!

<p><strong>Savagezen‚Äôs Angler Kernel:</strong></p>

<p>The kernel source has not changed.  However, of note, the <code class="highlighter-rouge">oreo-m3-release</code> branch from <a href="https://github.com/copperheados/kernel_huawei_angler">CopperheadOS/kernel_huawei_angler</a> has been removed.  I have not been able to track down the reason for this.  As such I will be considering moving to a different base kernel that is update more often.  The last push to the current CopperheadOS branches was almost one year ago (September 2017).</p>

<p>This month brings two releases (download links below) with differnet init / governor (Interactive) profiles.  The <code class="highlighter-rouge">sz</code> variant features my ‚Äúbattery saving‚Äù profile which replaces the previous ‚Äúbalanced‚Äù profile as the default.  The <code class="highlighter-rouge">fk</code> variant uses the <a href="https://forum.xda-developers.com/nexus-6p/general/power-profiles-francokernel-kernel-t3742799">Franco Kenrel Power Profile</a>.  A statistical comparison will come to follow:</p>
