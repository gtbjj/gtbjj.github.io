<p>There were some proposed solutions from the Arch forums having to do with LOCALE and package keyrings, but none of these solutions worked for me.</p>

<p>I found that the issue was persistent with upgrading any package except for LLVM related packages.  So, I was able to check which packages I had installed related to LLVM by running:</p>

<p>```
$ pacman -Ss | grep llvm | grep installed<code class="highlighter-rouge">
extra/llvm 7.0.1-2 [installed]
extra/llvm-libs 7.0.1-2 [installed]
multilib/lib32-llvm-libs 7.0.1-1 [installed]
</code>`</p>

<p>I went ahead and reinstalled the llvm libraries:</p>

<p><code class="highlighter-rouge">$ sudo pacman -S llvm-libs libs32-llvm-libs</code></p>

<p>That went as expected, but I got the former error when I attempted to reinstall LLVM itself (<code class="highlighter-rouge">$ sudo pacman -S llvm</code>).</p>

<p>The next logical step was to to uninstall (<code class="highlighter-rouge">$ sudo pacman -Rns llvm</code>) llvm before manually (re)installing it .</p>

<p><code class="highlighter-rouge">$ sudo pacman -S llvm</code> produced errors stating that various libraries already existed in the filesystem.  This is to be expected as the problem appears related to some, but not all, libraries having been removed somewhere along the line.</p>

<p>Forcing the installation (<code class="highlighter-rouge">$ sudo pacman -S --force llvm</code>) resolved the issue and I was then able to upgrade (<code class="highlighter-rouge">$ sudo pacman -Syu</code>) as per usual.</p>
