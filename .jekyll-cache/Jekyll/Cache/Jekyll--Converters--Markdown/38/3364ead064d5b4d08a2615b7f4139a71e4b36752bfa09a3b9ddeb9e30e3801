I"<h3 id="pure-aosp">Pure AOSP</h3>

<p>Every month I make a pure <a href="https://source.android.com/source/">AOSP build</a> from <a href="https://source.android.com/source/build-numbers#source-code-tags-and-builds">the latest Nexus 6P 
branch</a> and <a href="https://developers.google.com/android/drivers#angler">vendor 
binaries</a>.  I dont‚Äô have the time to figure out updater scripts as of late, but I can 
still host the generated images (<a href="https://mega.nz/#F!UmxjEAya!HJUnR9-F8qjYUFbI_Y9nYw">download boot/system/vendor images</a>).  <a href="http://opengapps.org/">Open 
GApps</a> does not yet support Android 8.0, so I also host another 8.0 GApps package I‚Äôve found (<a href="https://mega.nz/#F!UjQxgBxZ!GqjeySRzSKOR0E6j9xmI0A">download 
GApps</a>).</p>

<p>I also recommend checking your <a href="https://dl.twrp.me/angler/">TWRP version</a> and <a href="http://www.supersu.com/download">SuperSU version</a> when 
updating.  It may also be necessary to flash <a href="https://forum.xda-developers.com/nexus-9/development/fix-build-prop-variety-fix-aka-contact-t3133347">gladiac‚Äôs build.prop 
fix</a> as well.  All images can be 
downloaded directly to device and then falshed in TWRP.</p>

  <p>2017-11-08:  For several months now I‚Äôve been having build issues with AOSP and have not been able to update.  I have presented <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/47215205/android-build-error-make-build-core-main-mk21-run-soong-ui-error-1">the issue on 
StackOverflow</a>.  Until then, I 
recommend downloading and unzipping the lated <a href="https://developers.google.com/android/images#angler">factory image</a>.  From there, you can unzip 
the built .img and rather than ‚Äúflashall‚Äù, manually flash boot.img, system.img, and vendor.img.  After doing so you‚Äôll need to use fastboot to 
reinstall TWRP and then reflash SuperSU.  You do not need to add GApps when using this method.</p>

<h4 id="austins-rom">Austin‚Äôs ROM</h4>

<p>This ROM will feature an AOSP build plus my aFlash Kenrel (above), in additon to some other personal tweaks.</p>

<p>2017-11-08:  Due to the problems I‚Äôve been having building AOSP, my ROM development is on an indefinite hiatus.  However, as I continue to 
pull and theme different apps, there will be links posted to their respective repos.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><em>Developer Note:</em>  Color schemes for apps can be changed in:
<code class="highlighter-rouge">platform/pcakages/apps/APP_NAME/res/values/colors.xml</code></p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p><em>Developer Note:</em>  Can extract <code class="highlighter-rouge">system.img</code>, <code class="highlighter-rouge">boot.img</code>, and <code class="highlighter-rouge">vendor.img</code> from <a href="https://developers.google.com/android/images#angler">factory images</a>) by unzipping the downloaded file and contained .zip.</p>

<h4 id="nexus-6p-angler-kernel">Nexus 6P (Angler) Kernel</h4>

<p>Formerly, I had forked <a href="https://github.com/nathanchance/angler">Flash Kernel</a> and renamed the kernel <em>aFlash Kernel</em> after applying a personalized init profile via <a href="https://github.com/nathanchance/AnyKernel2">AnyKernel</a>.</p>

<p>Then I added many (many!) of the published interactive governor profiles around the interwebs to <a href="https://github.com/savagezen/anykernel">my AnyKernel repo</a> which alloed the profiles to be switiched in <a href="https://github.com/savagezen/anykernel/blob/angler-personal/ramdisk/init.profiles.rc">init.profiles.rc</a>.</p>

<p>The benefit here is that a single digit can be changed in <a href="https://github.com/savagezen/anykernel/blob/angler-personal/ramdisk/init.profiles.sh">init.profiles.sh</a> and the kernel can be re-zipped and flashed.  There‚Äôs no need to re-compile and this avoids the (in my experience) problem of apps such as Kernel Auditor sucking huge amounts of power to ‚Äúhold‚Äù settings ‚Äì which is very counter-intuitive.</p>

<p>The kernel was then, for a short term, dubbed ‚ÄúSavage Kernel‚Äù after Flash Kernel development (for Angler) appeared to stop at Android 8.0.0 (that is, at the time of writing, no 8.1.0 release has been made).  For simplicity sake I‚Äôve dropped any naming convention other than <code class="highlighter-rouge">made by @savagezen</code>.</p>

<p>Going forward my personalize kernel will adhere to the following principles:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Source</strong>:  The project will remain <a href="https://github.com/savagezen/kernel_huawei_angler">open source (GitHub)</a>‚Ä¶ always.</li>
  <li><strong>Security</strong>: The project is forked from the <a href="https://github.com/CopperheadOS">CopperheadOS</a> Angler kernel.  CopperheadOS is developed in line with <code class="highlighter-rouge">linux-hardened</code> (<a href="https://copperhead.co/android/docs/technical_overview">technical overview</a>).</li>
  <li><strong>Simplicity</strong>:  Features will be added only as needed.</li>
  <li><strong>Sanity (and balance)</strong>:  Simply put, I need my phone to get s* done and I want it done fast.  But, I don‚Äôt want to have to charge my phone between waking up and going to bed.  Uptimes and SOT (screen on time) can be manipulated, and synthetic benchmarks are not an accurate indication of day-to-day use.  All of those things are metrics for comoparison; tools for insight.</li>
</ul>

<blockquote>
  <p><em>Developer Note:</em>  Kernel / ROM does not need to be rebuilt to get latest security patch.  The <a href="https://developers.google.com/android/ota#angler">full OTA imagtes</a> can be flashed to gain the update (often sooner than their available OTA).  However, you need to reflash <a href="https://dl.twrp.me/angler/">TWRP</a> and reroot after doing so.  SuperSU did not work for me on Android v8.1.0, but Magisk did.</p>
