I" <p>Earlier this week I had the pleasure of running into some fine gentlemen form New York at Rocktown.  An ambitious crew, they set their sights early on <a href="http://www.mountainproject.com/v/the-orb/106036141">The Orb</a>.  After tossing around on a few easy(er) problems they spotted me around the other side of a boulder, introduced themselves and asked if I knew where to find the classic <a href="http://www.mountainproject.com/v/soap-on-a-rope/106036163">Soap on a Rope</a>.</p>

<p>I obliged their request and one of them sayâ€™s â€œItâ€™s a 4 right?â€  Coyly I reply, â€œThatâ€™s what the book says.â€  If you followed the above link or have climbed the line you know a bit better.  They quickly gathered sufficient evidence to make that judgment call themselves.  Though the problem wen unsent by the crew, a good time was had by all.  The New Yorkers shuffled desperately through the guidebook in search of some more vertical terrain that would be â€œeasyâ€ (ha!).  They read off a few high profile problems to which I chimed in, â€œyup, tried itâ€¦ itâ€™s hard.â€  After a few of these they asked.  <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">"Is everything just hard?"</code>  I found my reply to be more than sufficient, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">"What you see is what you get.  Welcome to the south gentlemen!"</code></p>

<p>At any rate, small talk struck up between burns and one of the fellas commented on a car in the parking lot with dress shirts hanging up and a heap of camping gear in the back.  <em>Yeah, thatâ€™s mine.</em>  I readily disclosed a bit about my lifestyle and come to find out one of their crew was also on a 3 month vacation adventure <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">"dirtbagging"</code>`.  I, on the other hand, have no real end in sight.  The longer this goes, the more sustainable it feels.</p>

<p>As I explained to the norther guests, of course living on the road was a huge, scary, dramatic change at first.  However, the longer this drags out the longer it feels like it could go on.  For example, if Iâ€™ve made it (almost) three months without losing my job, starving, or maintaining relatively respectable hygiene, then there really isnâ€™t any reason I canâ€™t do it for six moths.  Once that is accomplished, especially in the south, youâ€™ve made it through both the throws of summer and winter and why the hell not keep going?</p>

<p>Anyway, one of the norther gents commented that â€œYouâ€™ve got it madeâ€  in regard to â€œquick morning sessionsâ€ on the boulder field before heading to work in the afternoon / evening.  That was the first time I head the term â€œcleanbagging.â€  Interesting in deed and it gave me a bit of pause.  Iâ€™ll have to put a bit more thought still into it.  If youâ€™ve read many of my posts you know that Iâ€™m not exactly the prototypical dirtbag for either the stone master or present generation of climbers.  Like them I am homeless and love to climb and make every effort to spend every minute doing so.  However, unlike them I have a job that I love and if you were to catch me â€œduring normal business hoursâ€ you may very well confuse me with another of the Bourgeoisie.</p>
