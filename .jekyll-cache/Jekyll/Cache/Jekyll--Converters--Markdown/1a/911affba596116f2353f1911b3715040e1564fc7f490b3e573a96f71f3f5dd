I"Ô<p>There are dozens of nutrition related certifications out there.  How do you chose the one thatâ€™s best for you?  While dietitians require a license in the state they practice, the term â€œnutritionistâ€ isnâ€™t as tightly regulated.  Similarly, counseling requires a license, but â€œtherapistâ€ does not.  Obviously thereâ€™s room for some sketchy interpretation of ethics and scope of practice there â€“ donâ€™t get me start on <em>â€œlife coachesâ€</em>.</p>
