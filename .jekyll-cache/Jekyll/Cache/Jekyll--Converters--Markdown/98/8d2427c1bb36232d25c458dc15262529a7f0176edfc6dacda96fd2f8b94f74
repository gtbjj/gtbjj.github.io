I"<h3 id="introduction">Introduction</h3>

<p>This site has gone through many incarnations.  It began as a homemade wiki of tutorials, problems, and solutions Iâ€™d worked on with Arch Linux.  From there it journaled my rock climbing dirtbag adventures.</p>

<p>At some point quest logs from tabletop role playing games were added as well as development notes from my Android projects.</p>

<p>Eventually, I included more nutritional research I had done as well as some reflections on starting combat sports again.</p>
