I""<p>Maybe one of the most difficult things about jiu jitsu is measuring progress.  I’ve had several notebooks, spreadsheets, and apps over the years.  They all have pros and cons and I’ll get to those in a bit.</p>

<p>Lately, I’ve been going hard on the nutrition scene, but want to publicly publish some of my thoughts on jiu jitsu.  This is a new level to my training logs and aforementioned journals.  They’ve always been private prior.</p>

<p>I’ve watched that video from Chewy several times and I’ve settled on two primary content areas for this category of this site.  1) processing experiences (should anyone care to read them or not, they’re still a chronological snapshot for me), and 2) a list of goals or things to work on.</p>

<p>As I’ve mentioned before, I’ve used apps and posted screenshots to Instagram, etc… but the return has been minimal.  Writing in a paper journal takes more effort, but it also has a different impact on your neurocircuitry because of that.  Basically, apps are easy come, easy go.</p>

<p>I love spreadsheets.  However, it’s more of the same.  All the meticulous data crunching in the world doesn’t mean shit if you can’t get out there on the mat in test / change some things.</p>
