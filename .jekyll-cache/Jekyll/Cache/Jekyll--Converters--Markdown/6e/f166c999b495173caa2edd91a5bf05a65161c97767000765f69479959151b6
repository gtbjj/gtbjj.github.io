<p>Things are rapidly developing for Kombat Kitchen, so these newsletter updates are coming out more frequently than they will in the future.</p>

<p><strong>Beta Testing</strong></p>

<p>The beta version of the White Belt program has been in the wild for a bout a week now.  If  you’re a newsletter subscriber, you can still join the beta testers group on Telegram by sending me a message (<a href="https://t.me/savagezen">@savagezen</a>).  There’s still time to access content that is free for now.</p>

<p>Also, the name of the beta testers telegram group now reflects beta status so that users can retain access to the content therein when other groups are created in the future.  Likewise, this allows for content control (e.g. link and documents provided will change location in the future – watermarked PDFs for sale rather than shared links on Google Drive)</p>

<p>Lastly, the beta test is scheduled for at least another week.  After that time I will either extend the program for another two weeks and re-release the freebie offers, or send out a feedback survey.</p>

<p>Website and FAQs</p>

<p><a href="http://thekombatkitchen.com">thekombatkitchen.com</a> is now a subset of my personal website.  That said, I’ve added two slide shows, one to talk about the structure of Kombat Kitchen in general, and another to address frequently asked questions.  This works out well for folks who prefer <a href="http://carnivorejiujitero.com/feed.xml">RSS feeds</a> to email news letters – newsletter content will be published on the site as well.</p>

<p>I realize that this takes away some of the incentive for subscribing to the newsletter, but it adds incentive to Telegram users.  Which, intentionally, is the platform I’ve chosen for the community engagement that is an integral part of Kombat Kitchen.</p>

<p><strong>Store and Merchandise</strong></p>

<p>There is now a store section on thekombatkitchen.com it’s been published a proof of concept until beta testing has finished, then programs will be feature for sale there are they’re released.</p>

<p><strong>Nutrition for Minors</strong></p>

<p>Many people asked about this.  It’s taking longer than I expected because not all information is relevant to all age groups.  Furthermore, how parents approach nutrition with those age groups differs as well.  All of that is on top of the fact that I want the information provided to be understandable by the young people themselves, yet complex enough to address parental questions and potential concerns.</p>

<p>I do not have an ETA yet, but if you would like to beta test the children’s program (there will be specific recommendations by age group: &lt; 9, 9 - 14, 15+) when it is available, send me a message on Instagram or Telegram.</p>
