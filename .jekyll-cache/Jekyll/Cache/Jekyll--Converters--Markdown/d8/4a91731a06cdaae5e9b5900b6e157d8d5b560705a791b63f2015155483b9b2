I"Ñ<p>Once upon a time I recall my younger climber self scouring the interwebs for information on <em>training for climbing</em>.  What I could only see in 
retrospect though is that my meticulous number crunching and planning was mostly in vein.  That is not to say it wasnâ€™t a good habbit to get 
into, but at that <a href="http://www.climbstrong.com/articles/20140127">training age</a> I would have benefited just as well from any climbing 
related activity.</p>
