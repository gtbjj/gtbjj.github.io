I"Í<p>Alright everyone, this is my final review of the <a href="https://nutritionwithjudy.com/carnivore75hard/">Carnivore 75 Hard Challenge</a>!  To review, the challenge is 75 days long (obviously) and requires each of the following to be accomplished daily:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Eat a carnivore diet (duh!)</li>
  <li>Exercise 30 minutes</li>
  <li>Spend 15 minutes in the sun</li>
  <li>Keep and share a gratitude journal</li>
  <li>Perform one random act of kindness / give a sincere compliment</li>
  <li>Fast for at least 16 hours</li>
</ul>

<p>Fittingly, I finished the challenge today, on America‚Äôs birthday!  <em>Steak dance anyone?!</em>  First, I‚Äôll breakdown my notes from the last few weeks, then review the challenge as a whole and what I learned from it.</p>

<h5 id="weeks-8---11">Weeks 8 - 11:</h5>

<p><strong>‚ÄúTrust your body‚Äù</strong> is a phrase that gets tossed around a lot.  But in the cases of fasting, and sodium this was especially true for me.  I‚Äôm finishing up a follow up study on electrolytes and CVL (cardiovascular load) and one intervention required ‚Äúlow‚Äù sodium.  By my standards this was &lt; 3g / day.  I found that my body (under the current weather and training conditions) needs 2,500 mg minimum to survive with only minor cramps (though fatigue was still an issue).</p>

<p><strong>Training volume:</strong>  During this time, I jumped from training BJJ 5 - 7 hours / week to upwards of 10 hours.  Obviously, sleep and recover became issues here.  This was the time that inspired my <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubisD0McHkI">‚ÄúDo Athletes Need Drugs‚Äù video</a>.</p>

<p><strong>Fasting and Timing:</strong>  As I mentioned, adjusting to training 2x / day on my ‚Äúoff days‚Äù and still maintaining a 16 hour fast took some adjusting.  This is especially true when trying to eat within an hour of each training session to promote recovery (much more on this topic in the future!).  I began wondering if I was <em>‚Äúchasing too many rabbits‚Äù</em> as Dan John puts it.  I was really hungry after work one day, started cooking, and out of habit (OMAD) cooked (and ate!) an additional whole day‚Äôs worth of food(!).  Obviously, trying to overcompensate / restrict the next day failed miserably.  As noted above, I am training more now than when I was actively competing, and virtually double the volume of the last few months of lockdowns.</p>

<p><strong>Sleep and Heat:</strong>  I have been in a bit of a financial pinch and haven‚Äôt kicked on my air conditioning yet.  I cannot sleep (certainly not well) when it is hot and humid, so this prompted a lot of internal discussion whether or not and how much caffeine I wanted to consume to either: A) stay up later and sleep when it‚Äôs cooler (later than 1 AM), or B) get up earlier and get things done before going to work (7 AM start).  Similarly, I wondered about fasting and which meal to skip (breakfast or dinner?).</p>

<p><strong>Sun and Kindness:</strong>  I had a random encounter with a friend I hadn‚Äôt seen in a while and found out that, unfortunately she is quite ill.  We started talking about health and nutrition, work, and our social lives; and she remarked on the ‚Äúvisible and palpable‚Äù change (improvement) in my mood and overall demeanour.  I‚Äôm not making this s* up when I say carnivore (and sunshine and practicing kindness) improved my mood dramatically.</p>

<h4 id="overall-review">Overall Review:</h4>

<p>So, overall what did I learn from the challenge:</p>

<p><strong>Nutrition:</strong>  When I started this challenge I had already been doing a carnivore diet for a couple months, so this was actually the easiest part of the challenge.  Obviously I‚Äôll continue this practice.</p>

<p><strong>Movement:</strong>  Exercising wasn‚Äôt an issue either (see above training volume).  What did take a little finagling was getting 15 minutes of sun every day.  I live in the Southeast United States and it‚Äôs summer, so we get a lot of rain; sometimes for days on end.  Nevertheless, it‚Äôs easy enough to <em>average out</em> the sunlight ‚Äì soak up and store the Vitamin D!  Again, I‚Äôll obviously continue training, but also continue to make it a point to get out in the sunlight every day as I think this has a huge impact on our mood.</p>

<p><strong>Healing:</strong>  Fasting was somewhat difficult, or had some ups and downs.  It wasn‚Äôt difficult per-se, but took a lot of adjustments to fit shifting work, training, and sleep schedules.  Over the course of the challenge my longest fast was 32 hours, averaging 18 hours, and with rations from 16:8 to 20:4.  16:8 is pretty manageable whereas 20:4 is not really compatible when I‚Äôm training combat sports 2 x per day (up to 3 or 4 hours total).  I‚Äôm uncertain if I‚Äôll continue fasting in the future.  Most likely I‚Äôll adhere to a ‚Äúloose‚Äù fasting principle where I aim for a 16 hour fast, but don‚Äôt hold it against myself if an obscure work schedule or training binge throws a wrench in things.  In general, keeping to one or two meals per day accomplishes a similar effect in my opinion regardless of the exact hour-to-hour ratio (e.g.  is there a statistical significance between fasting for 12 hours versus 16?  Or between 16 and 18?).</p>

<p><strong>Mindset:</strong>  Between the sunlight, practicing gratitude, and practicing kindness to others, my mood definitely improved overall and I was a generally happier person.  In reality, coming from both my professional mental health training and personal experience, all of these things may make you more enjoyable to other people, but their really to your benefit.  It make <em>you</em> happier to practice happiness (gratitude) and it improves <em>your quality of life</em> to practice kindness and be complimentary of others ‚Äì given that you‚Äôre investing sincerity in those processes.  Lest, the opposite be true; you give hollow and fake compliments and superficial gratitudes, then become (not surprisingly) a disappointed, hollow, fake, lonely, angry person.  I don‚Äôt know that I‚Äôll continue a daily gratitude journal or daily random acts of kindness (that‚Äôs not really random, then is it?), but it is certainly a worthwhile point to remain mindful of and try to incorporate as often as possible, whether you‚Äôre ‚Äúticking the box‚Äù on your to-do list or not.</p>

<p><strong>Community:</strong>  This was a fun and challenging part as well, that I think (again), contributes to the <strong><em>make yourself a better person</em></strong> part of this challenge.  The COVID lockdowns didn‚Äôt stop my from attempting this practice.  It was rather delightful to have to think of other ways of engaging my community, be that <em>real goddamn phone call</em> just to chat with my family, or texting / reconnecting with a friend <em>out of the blue just to say hello</em>, or inviting people to my home to gather and celebrate each other.  Again, I doubt this will remain on my to-do list, but it will certainly remain in the forefront of my intentions as the challenge has highlighted the importance of being connected with and engaged in a tribe.</p>
