I"±<h4 id="week-2">Week 2</h4>

<p>A lot has been stirring with me the last couple days.  Wednesday and Thursday will were quite deep and difficult.  Simply put, it looks like I may be adding â€œunemployedâ€ to my dirtbag resume sooner rather than later.  Thursday, then, I hit the phone calls and emails hard and managed to schedule a few interviews for todayâ€¦. ya know, gotta keep your options open.  One the darker side of things; Iâ€™m not a huge Goo Goo Dolls fan, but it feels apt to say:</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>You'd love to go home
but you know you ain't got one
cuz you live in a world
where you're best forgotten
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Of course, that pitch isnâ€™t too far off from what youâ€™ll find in Cedar Wrightâ€™s <a href="http://www.climbing.com/blog/the-wright-stuff-dirtbagging-is-dead/">Dirtbagging is Dead</a> article.</p>

<p>On the climber / dirtbag side of things though that brought up a really serious point.  For now, this is an adventure and the adventure is still funâ€¦ or at least worth it.  I will say, sum of the shimmer has worn off.  this is a very l onely path and Iâ€™m pretty sick of seeing Barnes &amp; Noble and Walmart logos.  That said, a strange sort of â€˜normalâ€™ has set in.  No, this certianly isnâ€™t a vacation, but living day-to-day has itâ€™s own ways of developing routines and ritual pracitces â€“ though they may seem more like â€˜survival mechanisms.â€™</p>

<h4 id="laughter">Laughter</h4>

<p>I was people watching in a parking lot today (a frequent past time for the dirtbag) and saw a group of people â€“ three or four adults in their late 30s and a couple kids â€“ and several of the adults were laughing.  I donâ€™t mean a sheepish giggle.  I mean rumble and roar, knee-slapping, full on belly laughs.  I couldnâ€™t help of think of how pissed my grandma would be that peole would be making such a â€˜ruckusâ€™ or â€˜sceneâ€™ in public.  I, on the other hand, felt a rich and warm smile spread across my face.  I wonder when the last time I, or my grandma, or anyone reading this was as happy as those people were walking across a parking lot on a hot Friday night?</p>
