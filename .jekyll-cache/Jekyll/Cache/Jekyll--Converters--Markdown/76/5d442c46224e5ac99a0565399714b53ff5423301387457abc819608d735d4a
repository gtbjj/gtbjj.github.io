I"O<p>By the end of October, Kobmat Kitchen will be 100 days old!  There’s been a tremendous amount of growth and support since that time and I’m greatly appreciative of everyone who’s been involved.</p>

<p>As Kombat Kitchen continues to grow at a rapid pace, things are going to continue to change and have to be adjusted to accommodate that growth.  As the expression goes, things break in multiples of 3:  going from 1 sponsor to 3, 3 employees to 10, 10 clients to 30, etc…</p>

<p>This all mean I have to closely monitor insights and analytics to find out where I can best spend my time / energy and make sure I’m delivering what people are interested in.  Sometimes that my swallowing my personal interest(s) for the sake of better business practices (afterall, my IG account does say I’m a business and not a person :D).</p>

<p>The <a href="/posts/Kombat-Kitchen-newsletter-20200822/">last newsletter</a> was all the way back in August.  Some highlights since then:</p>
