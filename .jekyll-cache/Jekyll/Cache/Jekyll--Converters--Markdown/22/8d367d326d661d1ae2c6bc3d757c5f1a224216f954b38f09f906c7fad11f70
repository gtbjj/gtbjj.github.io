I"˜<p>How do you measure progress in BJJ (or any martial art for that matter)?  It can be quite a nebulous task to say the least.  Obviously there are belt rankings, but there can be (and often itâ€™s required by international committees) years between belt promotions.  Some, though certainly not all, gyms add stripes (up to four) to belt ranks, but even then youâ€™d be looking at 4 - 6 month intervals.</p>
