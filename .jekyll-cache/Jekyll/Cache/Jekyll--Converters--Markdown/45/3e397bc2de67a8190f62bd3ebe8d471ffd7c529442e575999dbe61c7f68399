I"¬<p>The firewall is one of the most basic components of your network security.  There are a lot of debates about Linux and security, but a firewall 
is a must regardless.  There are GUI tools available to help you do this (such as <a href="https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Uncomplicated_Firewall">Uncomplicated 
Firewall</a>), but going a bit more minimal has its benefits.</p>

<p>For one, it is a bit more invovled, but as is usually the case with more ‚Äúmanual‚Äù and minimal implementations, you learn more about the 
process.  This is done through a program called <a href="https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/iptables">iptables</a>.  The <a href="https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/simple_stateful_firewall">Arch Wiki section on Stateful 
Firewalls</a> is very detailed.  In addition to that, you can easily find a list of 
<a href="http://www.thegeekstuff.com/2011/06/iptables-rules-examples/">the 25 most common iptable rules</a>.</p>

<p>What can make this implementation painless is if you take the commands you issue (either through the 25 list or reading the wiki) and include 
them in a single script.</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>~/scripts/iptables.rules
---
# Simple Stateful Firewall

# Check current rules
#iptables-save

# Load Default Rules
#iptables-restore &lt; /etc/iptables/empty.rules

# Create Chains
iptables -N TCP
iptables -N UDP

# etc...
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Next, make the file executable:</p>

<p><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">$ chmod u+x ~/scripts/iptables.rules</code></p>

<p>Finally, create a shell alias in your ~/.{ba,z}shrc.  It 
will make sense here to fire up your network driver and 
deploy the firewall in one line like so:</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>~/.zshrc
---
alias wup="sudo wifi-menu; sudo ~/scripts/iptables.rules"
</code></pre></div></div>
