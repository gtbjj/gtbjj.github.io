<p>Previously I looked at <a href="/2019/blood-pressure-and-sodium/">blood pressure and sodium</a> (reduction).  The results there showed a marked improvement in my blood pressure, but soon after my blood pressure returned to it‚Äôs ‚Äúnormal‚Äù level.  In other words, perhaps I caught myself on a <em>very</em> good day (low stress perhaps) that showed such a sudden improvement.</p>

<p>At the start of this experiemnt my blood pressure was 144 / 88 (77 RHR) and the <strong>intervention</strong> I used was remvoing read meat (so chicken and fish only) as well trying to eat <a href="https://www.myfooddata.com/printables/foods-high-in-magnesium-printable.png">vegetables with higher magnesium content</a>.  For the three week test period I was consuming about 300 mg magnesium / day (<a href="https://photos.app.goo.gl/Xn5StjnVBTjqKx1x7">sample nutrient profile</a>)</p>

<p><strong>Results:</strong>  At the end of three weeks my blood pressure was 141 / 86 (59 RHR).  That is a very small, maybe not even significant effect.  It should also be noted that during this time I started practicing BJJ much more frequnetly and did some sort of combat related movement every day ‚Äì regarding the decrease in RHR.</p>

<h4 id="magnesium---take-two">Magnesium - Take Two</h4>

<p>After talking with the nurse friend who recomended increasing magnesium intake in the first place, I learned that the magnesium in raw food alone would likely have little effect blood pressure without external supplmentation (see <a href="https://www.livescience.com/55355-magnesium-blood-pressure.html">this article also</a>).  So, let‚Äôs give this another go!</p>

<p>Magnesium supplements can be found at virtually any pharmacy or drug store.  One thing to look out for though is that a quick Google search will tell you that (the more common) Magnesium Oxide has a lower absorption rate than (the slightly more expensive) Magnesium Citrate.  Opt for the later.</p>

<p><strong>Intervention (dosage):</strong>  2 x 250 mg servings / day.  This is a little high, but my daily intake was a little below the RDA (after rebalancing from <em>Take One</em> above).  However, the average was in the recommended range of about 700 - 800 mg / day between raw food and supplements.</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p><strong>Verdict:</strong>  That is a pretty impressive efect!  Though statistical significance will be tested in the future once I‚Äôve collected more data samples and can test each sample against the average.</p>
