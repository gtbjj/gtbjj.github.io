I"t	<p>There are several solutions out there for when Chromium complains about 
<em>connection not private</em>.  Commonly, you can click <em>advanced</em> and then 
<em>proceed anyway</em>.  However, sometimes there’s a problem with your SSL 
security certificates.  I’ll briefly cover some solutions here.</p>

<h3 id="date-and-time">Date and Time:</h3>

<p>Simply check your system’s date and time ala</p>

<p><code class="highlighter-rouge">$ date</code></p>

<p>specifically, check the year and, if needed correct with</p>

<p><code class="highlighter-rouge">$ timedatectl set-time YYYY-MM-DD</code></p>

<p>This is probably the most common response if you were to Google “chromium 
connection not private” or the error code
<code class="highlighter-rouge">NET:ERR_CERT_COMMON_NAME_INVALID</code> /
<code class="highlighter-rouge">NET:ERR_CERT_AUTHORITY_INVALID</code>.</p>

<p>While this has worked for me in the past, this was to no avail with my 
current case.  In fact, there was not even a <em>proceed anyway</em> option.  So, 
let’s continue…</p>

<h3 id="manually-update-certificate">Manually Update Certificate:</h3>

<ol>
  <li>Click on the certificate warning, it should pop up a lot of information 
about the certificate.</li>
  <li>Highlight the certificate from where it states <code class="highlighter-rouge">---BEGIN 
CERFICATE---</code> through the end.  Then, copy it to your clipboard.</li>
  <li>Paste that to a file such as <em>~/chromium.crt</em></li>
  <li>
    <p><code class="highlighter-rouge">$ certutil -d sql:$HOME/.pki/nssdb -A -t P -n chromium_cert -i 
~/chromium.crt</code></p>
  </li>
  <li>Restart chromium</li>
</ol>

<p>This <em>did</em> work for me.  See <a href="http://superuser.com/questions/104146/add-permanent-ssl-certificate-exception-in-chrome-linux">original solution source on 
superuser.com</a>.</p>

<h3 id="adding-self-signed-certificates">Adding Self-Signed Certificates:</h3>

<p>In a similar vein I decided to go ahead and proceed with this as well.<br />
Afer the above fix, Google app sites and a few others worked fine, but I 
was still getting the <em>connection not private</em> error fairly frequently.<br />
The procedure for this is clearly laid out in the relevant section of the 
Arch Wiki dealing with <a href="https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Chromium/Tips_and_tricks#SSL_certificates">Chromiun Tips / Tricks #SSL 
certificates</a>.</p>
