I"ñ<p>Week 1 I relied heavily on staying at a friendâ€™s house (4 / 8 nights) and 3 nights were spent in Walmart parking lots.  Last night was beautiful, 68 and breezy though a bit humid still.  No doubt, this will be a lonely journey.  I put over 3,000 miles on my car in July (actually closer to 3,500) between work and crag trips.  Iâ€™d say that i was on the road more than I was home, but then, reallyâ€¦ I am the highwayâ€¦ a modern day drifter.</p>

<p>Iâ€™ve been wondering about work too.  Finding a full-time job is a tedious process.  Come to think of it, my health insurance expires today.  Looks like Iâ€™ll be paying that federal fee when it comes tax time.  Life is hard.  Part of me doesnâ€™t want to give up <code class="highlighter-rouge">this dream</code> that Iâ€™m living now.  I suppose a 9-to-5 technically wouldnâ€™t have to change anything or stop me from being a dirtbagâ€¦ it may just mean that I can take showers more often!  But then there is my current job.  What is worth holding on to and when is it time to let go?</p>

<p>I did some math and without seeing any clients Iâ€™d actually be losing money at my job and thus need to quit.  However, only seeing one client on a weekly basis would cover my overhead and get me groceries; thus leaving my â€˜emergency fundâ€™ largely untapped.  This could go on virtually forever!</p>

<p>But Iâ€™m finding myself in a running (read levaing) kind of mood.  How far do i take this until it becomes warped to an entirely different state from what it was begotten as?  Iâ€™m speaking not just of climbing, but in the socio-political-spiritual realm(s) too.  is a relentless pursuit of freedom worth losing a large part of <code class="highlighter-rouge">the love of the game</code> that inspired chasing that freedom to begin?  I feel myself going to a pretty dark place here.  I want to hold and own that, but also the wonder and awe of the present moment Iâ€™m writing in.  Itâ€™s 70-something, 9:00-ish a.m., sunny, and by tomorrow Iâ€™ll have been out on the rocks 5 / 7 days.  My â€œneighborsâ€ are â€“ to put it politely â€“ gym-goers, but mostly quiet and keep to themselves.  The only sound I hear harmonizing in the background of my own thoughts is a steady breeze with scattered bird-chirp accents.  The rising sun is almost in my face now.  Iâ€™m reminded of <a href="http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/camus/">Camus</a>â€™ proverb:</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><table class="rouge-table"><tbody><tr><td class="rouge-gutter gl"><pre class="lineno">1
</pre></td><td class="rouge-code"><pre>There are those who choose to look their fate in the eye (and cry out "no")."
</pre></td></tr></tbody></table></code></pre></div></div>

<p>As my <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lacanianism">Lacanian</a> colleagues would put it.  â€œHereâ€™s to forever lacking (so as to remain able to be moved).â€</p>
