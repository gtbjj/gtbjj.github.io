I"-<p>Recently after restoring my system I’ve been getting some 
funky erorrs when compiling / installing AUR packages and Ruby Gems.  At first I thought 
the issue was specific to the repspective programs.  (e.g. 
the ones being compiled by ABS and the gem in question).</p>

<p>However, upon closer inspection, both errors were related 
to the execution of c programmed executables.  Some quick 
Googleing lead me to <a href="https://bbs.archlinux.org/viewtopic.php?id=107372">this Arch Linux forum 
thread</a>.</p>

<p>I don’t remember ever manually doing anything to
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">glibc</code> as suggested in the thread, but at any rate, a 
simple upgrade did the trick for me.</p>

<p><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"># pacman -S glibc gcc</code></p>
