I"R!<p>I recently got a copy of <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Controlled-Aggression-Girard-Bradshaw/dp/B005D2SAQ6/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1548425622&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=controlled+aggression">Controlled Aggression</a> by <a href="https://www.instagram.com/tarheelk9/">Jerry Bradshaw</a> which I’m very excited to start reading.  I’ve been a listener of the <a href="http://controlledaggressionpodcast.com/">Controlled Aggression Podcast</a> since it started.  As I work my way through the book I’m going to make summary posts of different chapters as reminders to myself and hope they can be of use to others as well.</p>

<h3 id="temperment-evaluation">Temperment Evaluation</h3>

<p>In each section I’ve made notes of Jerry’s <em>goals</em> for police / protection (sport) training.  In general, Jerry describes these evaluating these temperment traits somewhere between the age of <strong>10 monts to 2.5 years</strong> for <strong>green dogs</strong>.  Also, in general, <strong>better sociability = better nerves</strong> and <strong>weaker nerves = less influence of drives on temperment</strong>.  We’ll get a closer look at this when I talk about my dog Dean at the end of the post.</p>

<p>The following temperment characteristics are covered:</p>

<ul>
  <li><em>Socialization</em>:  Interaction with people / animals in public (different than trainer / handler / owner relatoinship)</li>
  <li><em>Nerves</em>:  Adaptability to change</li>
  <li><em>Drives</em>:  Genetic motivators present in all dogs, but to differing degrees</li>
  <li><em>Hardness</em>:  Resilience to adversity (or correction)</li>
  <li><em>Focus</em>:  Relationship to traininer</li>
  <li><em>Attention Span:</em>  Relationship to environment</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>1) Public Sociability (not personal / pack sociability):</strong></p>

<ul>
  <li><em>social dog</em> = confident and forced greeting (though, sometimes to submit to dominant dog)</li>
  <li><em>neutral dog</em> = “no fear is registered, and the dog simply ignores the stranger (to avoid conflict)”, can be handler dependent or defensive</li>
  <li><em>unsocial dog</em> = refuses to approach or allow anyone to approach</li>
</ul>

<p><em>Goal:  Social or (confident) Neutral</em></p>

<p><strong>2) Nerves (Adaptability to Change):</strong></p>

<ul>
  <li><em>Fluid</em> (adaptability) = no hesitation and immediate acceptance of change</li>
  <li><em>Studied</em> (adaptability) = initial concern, but able to investigate and confident enough to negotiate without lingering</li>
  <li><em>Cautious</em> (adaptability) = dog adapts, but takes “shepherding” through changes by trainer</li>
  <li><em>Incomplete</em> (adaptability) = dog is funcitonal in new environment, but never to same degree as familiar landscape</li>
  <li><em>Halted</em> (adaptability) = dog is minimally funcitonal in new environment and never improves from this level</li>
  <li><em>Accelerated</em> (adaptability) = dog who cannot function at all in new environment and shuts down despite trainer’s efforts</li>
</ul>

<p><em>Goal:  Fluid or Studied adaptability</em></p>

<p><strong>3) Drives:</strong></p>

<ul>
  <li><em>Prey</em> (hunting and retrieving) = desire to chase, catch, and / or kill</li>
  <li><em>Social</em> (pack) = very imporant for (competitive) obedience; “willingness to please”, tactile / verbal reward</li>
  <li><em>Defense</em> (of prey, territory, self) = dogs with low defense threshold = poor candidate for compulsive training methods</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>4) Hardness:</strong></p>

<ul>
  <li><em>Hard</em> = “dog can take a stout correction”</li>
  <li><em>Soft</em> = “dog becomes upset or overly submissive after mild correction”</li>
</ul>

<p><em>Goal:  “…soft enough to respond properly to crrection, but not so hard that we will have to abandon positve punishment (all together).”</em></p>

<p><strong>5) Focus and Attention Span:</strong></p>

<ul>
  <li><em>Outwardly-Focused</em> = “responds to distractions more than the attractions of the handler”
    <ul>
      <li>can result from low defense threshold (concerned with threats), lacking social skills, or very high prey drive</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><em>Inwardly-Focused</em> = dog is “unconcerned with environment” and “always looking to the trainer.”
    <ul>
      <li>could be because of good socialization <strong>or</strong> over-dependenmce on handler</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><em>(low) Attention Span</em> = “usually referrs to younger dogs who may have a high capacity for attentiveness, but who are still experiencing their environment, and are distracted but will return focus.”</li>
</ul>

<p><em>Goal: Inwardly-Focused, but not unablt to work independent of handler.</em></p>

<p>Let’s look at my 3 year old GSD / Malinois mix, Dean:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Socialization:</strong>  Dean is pretty chill in a <strong>neutral</strong> environment and around neutral dogs / people.  However, he is very (defensively) confident when provoked either through prey or defense.</li>
  <li><strong>Nerves:</strong>  Dean’s behavior is soemwhere between <em>Cautious</em> and <em>Fluid</em> adaptability.  At a minimum he is cautious of performing a task in a new environment or slight change in task, but with a little guidance to remind him what we’re up to , it’s business as usual.  I’d actually say his adaptability is pretty fluid and any hangups are related to drive and focus / attention span (below).</li>
  <li><strong>Drive:</strong>  Dean is a bit of a prey monster.  He will chase and bite pretty much anything that you wave in front of his face, moves fast, or makes loud noises.  So his  prey drive is <strong>high</strong>.  I’d say his defense drive is <strong>medium</strong> since he is unusually quiet (for a shepherd) around the home and other people.  However, he is very defensive of himself and me against other dogs.  As for pack (social) drive, he definitely has a strong desire to  please, but only moderate response to tactile / rewards (not none, as food / toy rewards have become variable in our trianing).</li>
  <li><strong>Hardness:</strong>  Dean is a rescue, and denfinitely had a lot of submissive reactiveness when I first picked him up about a year ago.  He was, and largely still is, a <strong>soft</strong> dog.  However, I have noticed that his <em>“hardness”</em> is highly dependent on his state of drive.  Chilling at home, a harsh word might cause him to slinking body posture.  On the other hand, if we’re out for a walk and training off lease and a stray cat give chase and springs from under a car as we’re passing by, it might take a very stout leach or e-collar correction to bring his attention back to me and he thinks nothing of it.</li>
  <li><strong>Focus and Attention Span:</strong>  Dean is more outwardly focused (see above on drive and socialization), though it is not too difficult for me to recapture his attention depending on the level of distraction (e.g. a jug of rocks or can curtain at home vs. heeling through PetSmart during active cat adoptions; <a href="https://www.instagram.com/stories/highlights/18027998203060710/">video on Instagram</a>).  Given Jerry’s description of short attention span, this seems just the case for Dean.  He <em>is</em> more focused on the environment, but <em>can</em> be redirected to attentiveness with practice.  See also when I talked about Dean’s “hardness.”</li>
