<p>At most camping locations you can find a water spigot not too far off.  However, in the event that you cannot there are still some options available which I‚Äôll discuss here as that is currently my situation.  A couple things to consider.  First, if you‚Äôre a weekend warrior or just hitting the crag for an afternoon / day trip then it‚Äôs not difficult to pack all the water you‚Äôre willing to carry.  For longer term situations it‚Äôs a different story.  Secondly, I‚Äôm not talking surrvivor-man-style here.  Although I‚Äôm an official dirtbag now, I‚Äôd like to make this life as comfortable as I can.  Basically, you can‚Äôt practice survival skills and climb at optimal performance at the same time, they‚Äôre inherently contradictory.  I‚Äôm also not talking about big wall trip either as that is a whole different animal.</p>

<h4 id="consumption">Consumption:</h4>
<p>How muh water do you use on a daily basis?  Remember to inclue cooking and cleaning (though these can be kept pretty minimal). I began this test process with 8 gallons  of bottled water (gallon jugs) that cost me $6.90 so even for a dirtbag, that‚Äôs worthy researh investment.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The Day:  80 - 85 `F, moderate humidity, mostly sunny, 1.5 hours of hiking, 2 - 3 hours of climbing.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>Water Consumption:  I drink a lot of water.  So for me modest cooking, skimpy cleaning and drinking totalled about 3 gallons on the test day.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>Notes:  The weather conditions were pretty modest for summer in the south, so 4 gallons might be a liberal estimate for any given day, or perhaps requisite on a particularly hot and steamy day.  On the other hand a conservative ‚Äúmake it stretch‚Äù mindset might work with 2 gallons with good weather.  One should also be awawre of observer biases.  I wasn‚Äôt being particularly conservative with my consumption as I wanted the estimate to be both accurate and indicative of a comfortable and well hydrated day (as I said above not trying to skimp by on the bare minimum).</p>
</blockquote>

<h4 id="cost">Cost:</h4>
<p>There are a few options available.  I have a 7 gallon BPA free jug (&lt; $15) which is optimal if there is a spigot, in my current location there is not (NOTE:  I don‚Äôt know if it fits the refill station mentioned below).</p>

<p><strong>Option 1</strong>:  Individual Gallon Jugs</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Cost &lt; $1 / gallon (~$0.86 in my test)</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>Pros:  You can get as much as you need at onece (i.e. several days‚Äô worth)</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>Cons:  Storage space and waste could be an issue.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><strong>Option 2</strong>:  Large Office-Style Jug</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>$12.00 for the first gallon, $0.37 / gallon on refills</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>Pros:  Refillable</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>Cons:  Limited amount per fill</p>
</blockquote>

<h4 id="conclusion">Conclusion:</h4>
<p>I‚Äôll spare you the maths and just say that the individual gallons are cheaper at the 10 gallon mark, but by the 20 gallon mark the office-jug is cheaper.  However, there are some practical things to consider.  The jugs will be reusable and for many different functions.  Also, the office-jug is meant for one thing; meaning it wont be very convenient to hoist overhead when yo uonly want a few swigs or to wrestle around (since it doesn‚Äôt have a spout like the camping one I mentioned earlier) to fill other containers and cookware.  For me the individual gallons win on logistics.  Cheers!</p>
