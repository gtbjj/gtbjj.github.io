I"ý<p>It seems like Google is trying to phase out the personal library functionality of <a href="https://books.google.com/">the old Google Books</a> in favor of 
<a href="https://play.google.com/books">Google Play Books</a>.  Now, Google Play Books is pretty nice.  However, if youâ€™re like me, then you uploaded a 
hoard of PDFs to the old module which was especially nice since it didnâ€™t count towards your Google Drive storage.</p>

<p>I found out recently that using <a href="https://www.google.com/webhp?sourceid=chrome-instant&amp;ion=1&amp;espv=2&amp;ie=UTF-8#q=how%20to%20download%20play%20books%20offline">standard download 
instructions</a>, you 
can not download the old books (or even open them in some cases).  This was both frustrating and disapointing both for the mobile and desktop 
variants.</p>

<p>Fortunately, a bit of Googling landed me at the below link which worked like a charm.  You can archive all of your Play Book (or any / all of 
your Google account information) and have it emailed to you or added to an assortment of cloud storage services.  You can then download and 
unzip / untar the content.</p>
