I"Ö<p>I ran into a quick little issue today and wanted to document the solution for myself.</p>

<p>After an upgrade and reboot, <a href="https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/SLiM">SLiM</a> did not load correctly on itâ€™s usual TTY.  I manually logged in
via console and attempted <code class="highlighter-rouge">$ startx</code>.  I was met with an error about the xserver connection being refused.  This was confirmed in
<code class="highlighter-rouge">/var/log/Xorg.0.log</code>.</p>

<p>Thinking logically, I checked <code class="highlighter-rouge">~/.xinitrc</code> to see if there was anything wonky or misconfigured.  It was not (tested by commenting out
everything except window manager deployment).</p>

<p>Next, I checked if I had a video driver installed (not sure how that would slip through the cracks though!).</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><table class="rouge-table"><tbody><tr><td class="rouge-gutter gl"><pre class="lineno">1
2
</pre></td><td class="rouge-code"><pre>austin @T530 ~  pacman -Qe | grep intel
xf86-video-intel 1:2.99.917+831+ge7bfc906-1
</pre></td></tr></tbody></table></code></pre></div></div>

<p>Just as a litmus test I uninstalled the package and rebooted to see if the issue persisted.  It did.  So, I reinstalled the video driver and 
looked
in <code class="highlighter-rouge">/var/log/slim.log</code> for more information and found:</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><table class="rouge-table"><tbody><tr><td class="rouge-gutter gl"><pre class="lineno">1
2
3
</pre></td><td class="rouge-code"><pre>slim: waiting for X server to begin accepting connections
Giving up.
slim: unable to connect to X server
</pre></td></tr></tbody></table></code></pre></div></div>

<p>Thanks to some quick Googling (used smartphone) the quick fix I found was to <code class="highlighter-rouge">$ sudo rm /etc/X11/xorg.conf</code>.  Then reboot and things worked as 
normal.</p>
