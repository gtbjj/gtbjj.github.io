  <p>If you’ve read the introduction on <a href="/tabs/kombat_kitchen">the Kombat Kitchen Page</a> you can see how these kinds of templates (which will be referenced in other Change Maker posts) don’t have to be dry or impersonal, but they are very effective at delivering a “to-the-point” and clear message that:</p>

<p><em>Title: XXXXXXXXX</em></p>

<p><em>(Description): I’m looking for {number of people} {gender}, ages {age range} who live in {location} and are looking to {goal}.</em></p>

<ul>
  <li><em>Gender</em></li>
  <li><em>Age</em></li>
  <li><em>How committed are you to X (meh &gt; catch fire to meet it)</em>
    <ul>
      <li><em>pick a goal from the deliverables in “hopeful future”</em></li>
      <li><em>phone number</em></li>
    </ul>

</ul>

<p>In Practice:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>I haven’t experimented with this a ton, as I’m still building my reach.  Obviously the efficacy of the survey is only as good as its reach and return.  However, I haven’t lost sight of the idea.  Followers on <a href="https://instagram.com/savagezen">Instagram</a> know that I frequently post “polls” in my stories to get feedback from and a keep a close bead on my audience.</p>

<h3 id="survey-selling-part-3--follow-up">Survey Selling, Part 3:  Follow Up</h3>

<ul>
  <li>Respond w/in 20 minutes of survey being completed</li>
  <li>Try to schedule during first call / contact</li>
  <li>If not (their washy, or need to check finances / spouse / schedule / etc), make follow up contact 1 week later.</li>
  <li>If no reply or still washy, continue weekly follow up for 1 month or until they say their not interested.</li>
</ul>

<p><em>In Practice:</em></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>I haven’t used this follow up schedule in regard to survey responses, but I have used it in both in-person and online conversations.  It helps to establish some healthy boundaries.  For example, someone asking me a general question on IG is fine, I’m happy to help.  They difference is in soliciting personal recommendations (e.g. what do you think about dairy? vs. should I eat dairy?).  If my default response is, “let’s schedule a 30 min consult ($20) on Saturday and chat about it” that tells me right away whether or not they’re serious or just trying to scrape something for free.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>The identified schedule is also a good balance to make sure you’re not being too pushy, but not losing potential lead as well.  So if the above scenario unfolds and someone says they have to check / with X then I let it go and make a note on my to-do list to text them 1 week later.  People have busy lives and sometimes do legitimately “forget to get back to you” or some other craziness happens in their life.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>Kombat Kitchen is still too young (at the time of this writing) to have tested different follow up schedules.  Though the principles stay true:</p>
</blockquote>

<ul>
  <li>Random Encounter / Conversation in Public:  Follow up by texting info / resources, whatever they asked for within an hour.</li>
  <li>Casual Conversation with a Friend / Colleague:  Send a <strong>gentle</strong> solicitation 24 hours later.</li>
  <li>Someone Solicits Me for nutrition advice (virtual or in person):  (grab my phone) “Let’s set something up!” –&gt; follow up 1 week later –&gt; follow up 2 weeks after that –&gt; follow up one month after that (more conservative than JBs recommendation).</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="survey-selling-part-4-analysis-bonus">Survey Selling, Part 4: Analysis (bonus)</h3>

<p>As my business is still in its infancy, the above was all written (except from the <em>in practice</em> excerpts) from speculation as I worked through that chapter in Change Maker.  Around the same time I ran a couple quick polls in my Instagram story just to do a validity check.  I asked:</p>

<ul>
  <li>What do you use food for: Fuel or Fun?</li>
  <li>Don’t confuse mass with strength.  If you had to pick: lose fat or build mass?</li>
  <li>Which matters more to you: performance or health?</li>
</ul>

<p>This maybe took 15 minutes to post and returned invaluable insight.  Let’s take a look:</p>

<ul>
  <li>90% of respondents said “fuel.”  Good news.  I didn’t expect many of them to have cultural / religious limitations to their dietary practices, but it’s an important coaching consideration nonetheless.</li>
  <li>66% of respondents preferred to lose fat over build mass.  As expected, a handful of people wanted to build mass, though I specified that mass was not the same as strength since I’m focusing on the nutritional component of things, not the weight room.</li>
  <li>64% of respondents valued performance over health.  This is very important data.  Obviously both are good things, but when forced to make a choice, it’s clear what my audience is asking for.</li>
</ul>

<p>The snapshot of my audience then, looks like:</p>

<ul>
  <li>no cultural / religious food restrictions,</li>
  <li>wants to lose fat, and</li>
  <li>improve performance.</li>
</ul>

<p>Very cool stuff and powerful insight from such simple interventions!</p>
