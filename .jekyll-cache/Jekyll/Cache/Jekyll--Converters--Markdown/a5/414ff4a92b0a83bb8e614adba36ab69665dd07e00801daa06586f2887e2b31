<p>A short post here to highlight some of 
<a href="https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/SLiM">SLiM</a>â€™s 
configuration options.  SLiM is a lightweight and easily 
customizable display manager.  Itâ€™s responsible for 
starting the <em>x window</em> environment on login.  (<a href="https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Display_manager">More about 
display managers</a>)</p>

<p><em>Quick Note</em>:  The Arch Wiki gives a warning about SLiMâ€™s compatibility 
with <em>systemd</em>.  However, Iâ€™ve never had an issue that was directly 
related to SLiM.</p>

<p>The config file in qustion is: <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">/etc/slim.conf</code>.  The 
configuration file has pretty good descriptions of the 
options, so Iâ€™ll just go over some of my favorites here.</p>

<ul>
  <li>numlock</li>
</ul>

<blockquote>
  <p>This is a simple option that youâ€™ll probably want so that you donâ€™t hvae 
to manually do it either for login password entry or during regular use.</p>
</blockquote>

<ul>
  <li>default_user</li>
</ul>

<blockquote>
  <p>This will save a second or two of not having to manually enter your 
username at login.  Relevant if you have a single user system.</p>
</blockquote>

<ul>
  <li>current_theme</li>
</ul>

<blockquote>
  <p>The default theme is pretyt hideous in my opinion, 
soâ€¦ The 
<a href="https://www.archlinux.org/packages/extra/any/archlinux-themes-slim">archlinux-themes-slim</a> 
package contains several clean good looking themes.  After 
installing the package, the themes are stored in
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">/usr/share/slim/themes</code>.  Set the <em>current_theme</em> 
option to the themeâ€™s name listed in the above directory.</p>
</blockquote>

<ul>
  <li>auto_login</li>
</ul>

<blockquote>
  <p>This is a convenient option for single user systems who 
might <a href="https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Dm-crypt/Encrypting_an_entire_system">encrypt an entire 
system</a>.<br />
You wouldnâ€™t want this if youâ€™re only encrypting <em>/home</em> 
(because whatâ€™s the point then) or if there are multiple users on the system.</p>
</blockquote>

<ul>
  <li>login_command</li>
</ul>

<blockquote>
  <p>Given your circumstances, you may want to have a certain 
program or shell script run upon login.  This is where you 
would enter that.</p>
