I"æ<p>The past couple weeks I‚Äôve actually been considering reintegration to a ‚Äúregular life.‚Äù  You see, unlike many other gypsies and dirtbags I‚Äôm trying to hold down a full time job.  On top of that it‚Äôs not a restaurant a couple miles off the trailhead and it‚Äôs not an online sales and / or writing gig.  After being at this for over two months, I‚Äôve at least figured out how to survive; so actually <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">living this lifestyle</code> is not the issue.  The issue is that there is more.  There is always more.</p>

  <p>My job requires me to travel a lot.  Public wifi is great for cruising social media and watching climbing videos while sipping coffee.  However, it‚Äôs quite a hassle to have to pack up all your belongings sloppily strewn in a booth at a fast food joint, do you business in the bathroom, return to your seat, set up everything again, then finally get back where you left off.  Compare that to the 30 seconds it takes to traverse your living room to the hallway, relieve yourself, and return to the cockpit at your desk.</p>

  <p>So, I was actually looking at apartments in the areas that I work.  Rent was about what I‚Äôd expected, but I quickly realized that they cost way too much.  Now, the price was reasonable for what you got, but I didn‚Äôt need or want most of what they were offering.  I don‚Äôt suspect many landlords would be willing to cut rent in half if I told them all I needed was a toilet, shower, and wifi; no kitchen, bed / futon, living space, shelves, or refrigerator required.  I guess I‚Äôll leave that issue tabled for now.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>I suspect that most dirtbags choose to go down the road we find ourselves on to avoid the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">9 to 5 grind</code>, the hour plus commutes, neckties and ass kissing, and trivial yet oppressing bureaucracies of <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">the modern (business) world.</code>  In other words, they hate their job and probably their life and have set out in search of a new one.  Perhaps they find what they‚Äôre looking for on the road or it is the seeking that fulfills them.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>I truly love my job and can‚Äôt imagine doing anything else.  At the same time though I‚Äôm caught in a 22.  The ‚Äú<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">dream</code>‚Äù I‚Äôve sold and given so much to chase down, the dream of climbing ‚Äì read explore yourself physical and mental limits in natural expression ‚Äì where and whenever you want to.  Yet the profession I feel called to and captivated by is at least a constricting as the corporate world, if not more.  The only difference is a question of will and desire.  Where you want to be.  Where you find yourself.  What you‚Äôre with and without.  Where you‚Äôre going and what will it take to get there, or what you will give to stay.</p>

<p><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">I keep my visions to myself.</code></p>

<p><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">It's only me who wants to wrap around your dreams</code></p>

<p><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Dreams of loneliness like a heartbeat drives you mad</code></p>

<p><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">in the stillness of remembering what you had</code></p>

<p><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">and what you lost</code></p>

<p><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">and what you had</code></p>
