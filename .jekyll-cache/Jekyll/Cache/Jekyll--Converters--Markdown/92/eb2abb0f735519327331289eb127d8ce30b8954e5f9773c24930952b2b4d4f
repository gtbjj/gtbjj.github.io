I"`<p>It is one of those days when you hate the world.  I want to destroy something beautiful.  The day started grand:  a routine work meeting in the mid-day then I was off to the crag.  After some trying and heady moderates i was satisfied with the afternoon.  I still needed to save some daylight to hike out and set up camp.  As I approached the parking lot I thought my car looked a bit lopsided.  As I got closer I knew what had happened.  I spoke aloud with irony and sarcasm:  <code class="highlighter-rouge">Well, i didn't park in a hole so this can only mean one thing.</code> (flat tire).</p>

<p>It turned out a very good thing that I had saved both plenty of strength and daylight to change the tire.  What would have normally been one of those ```well that sucks`` everyday inconveniences of life was a bit more extreme since everything I own was in the trunk on top of my spare tire.  So, there in the dirt and gravel and mud I sprawled out all my worldly possessions and got to work.  After descending the mountain – no small task on a spare tire mind you – I found that I had missed the closing time of every tire shop in town by about 20 minutes.  Wonderful…  Even better, none of them opened before 9:00 a.m.  Again, normally this wouldn’t be a problem except that I’m trying to hold down a job while dirtbagging and had a noon appointment two hours away the next morning and in need of a shower beforehand.</p>

<p>I found out that a Walmart tire center about an hour away opened an hour earlier.  In case you didn’t know; spare tires are made to get you to a service center or somewhere where a tow truck can reach you.  They’re not meant for a full on replacement for road trips and / or highway speeds.  I decided to chance it.  Alas, the <code class="highlighter-rouge">low tire pressure</code> light came on.  Again, this would normally only have been a minor inconvenience; I’d actually kind of expect it from a 10+ year old spare tire.  But – there is, of course, a “but” – I was out of cash and whilst riding a spare tire hard in no condition to be stingy about which gas station I stopped at for air.  We all know that gas station ATMs have wonderful transaction fees, so all in all I paid $3.50 for about 20 seconds of air.</p>

<p>Fortunately this story ends well as I spent the night in the Walmart parking lot (this is going to happen quite often if you’re a dirtbag) and pulled in to the tire center at 8:00 a.m. sharp.  Tire replaced (for less than I expected actually) and car repacked in under an hour and I casually arrived at my appointment on time.</p>
