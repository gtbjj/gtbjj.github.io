I"o<p>When I look back at my training in 2019, what were the biggest keys to my improvement over the year?  For the purposes of this post, I’ll stay away from the obvious general things like a quality instructor and gym culture / community you resonate with – as well as all / any logistical and financial factors.</p>

<p>So, in January of 2019 I was a two stripe blue belt who hadn’t trained in over five years.  In February of 2020 I earned by purple belt.  Obviously I got a thing or two right.  When I look back on the year (it was December / January when this was originally drafted) there are some BJJ specific and some non-specific things that stood out to me.</p>

<p><strong>Keys to Improvement:  BJJ Specific:</strong></p>

<p>Again, these are my reflections on my process, not general advice.  Your mileage may vary.</p>

<ul>
  <li><em>Matt Time:</em>  You just have to get out there!  As we are all being reminded now during the COVID-19 situation, there’s no substitute for time on the mat.  Of course, things like movement, strength, conditioning, and flexibility are beneficial; but they are no replacement for the real deal.  Training once per week for a year gets you in a different p lace than four times per week.  Likewise, how attentive and focused you are for those hours / sessions make a difference as well.  In 2019 I saw almost 300 hours of mat time.</li>
  <li><em>Film Study:</em>  I’m not talking about instructionals, though those can be helpful.  I’m talking about watching competitions, high level ones – EBI, Worlds, ADCC, etc…  What’s more, I’m not talking about watching them for entertainment (of course I do this too!), but stopping, pausing, replaying, repeating… to really try to understand how transitions and movements for top level players are working together.  Usually I will turn the sound off and do my own commentary, out loud, so that I can process “what would I do in that situation” or anticipate what will happen next.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Keys to Improvement:  Non-Specific:</strong></p>

<p>This could be summed up in one word, <em>recovery</em>!  Restarting my fight career at 31 required something quite different than it did at 22.  In terms of performance, I’m probably better than ever.  Though, as any aging athlete will tell you, it’s the recovery time that really creeps up on you.  Also, as we all should know, you get weak when you train.  <em>You get stronger when you rest.</em></p>
<ul>
  <li><em>Nutrition:</em>  As you will quickly find on this site, I keep my nutrition pretty dialed in.  My rationale is simple.  We all have to eat.  While you’re at it, take some accountability for the results are yielded from what you put in your mouth.  Nutrition not only fuels performance, but recovery, overall health and well being.  All of our body’s systems require energy and that energy comes from the fuel we put in our bodies.  Make it count.  I’m not saying every athlete should go full carnivore; but make damn sure you’re at least <a href="/posts/common-sense-nutrition/">doing the obvious</a>, getting enough protein (1-2g / Kg of bodyweight), and maybe cutting back on the carbs.</li>
  <li><em>Sodium / Electrolytes:</em>  I’d have to say this was the most effective and affordable “supplement” I’ve tried.  More than whey protein, yes.  More than CBD, yes.  There is a lot of controversy (see more in the <a href="/categories/nutrition">nutrition section</a>) around the AHA’s recommendation of &lt; 2g sodium / day and whether this is applicable for athletes, let alone low carb ones.  I’ve written a lot about sodium elsewhere on this site (DM me on Twitter / IG / Telelgram for resources), so I’ll just say that a sedentary, overweight person scarfing Cheetos is not the same as 10 hours of BJJ / week, in the August heat, in Georgia.  If you want brand recommendation, again, shoot me a message on Twitter, Telegram, or IG.</li>
  <li><em>Sleep:</em>  I am still working on this one whilst in a fierce battle with caffeine (which I’ve also studied several times on this site).  Not only getting more sleep, but getting better quality and letting your body restore itself naturally.  That means taking naps if your tired, going to bed at a regular time, and waking up at a regular time (even on weekends!).  It also means staying away from drugs, prescribed or otherwise (alcohol, caffeine, nicotine, melatonin, etc…)</li>
