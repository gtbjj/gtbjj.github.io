<p><strong>Question 5:</strong>  <em>What relationship do you want with your income?</em></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>I would prefer a steady income.  Though, I don’t mind hustling; especially if I feel invigorated and fueled by the work or have the right system / people in place to support me.  I’m not shooting for a extremely affluent lifestyle, but have a figure in mind where I’d like to be to live the type of lifestyle I want.  Therefore, a combination short and long term contracts seems appropriate.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><strong>Question 6:</strong>  <em>What relationship do you want with your work?</em></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Initially I want to start part-time and scale to full-time as I learn more about business and marketing and the interest / populations in my area.  I would prefer flexibility over structure, but this depends on a lot on the previous question.  If I have a lot of long term contracts, then flexibility within those contracts feels best for me.  In contrast, if juggling multiple short term contracts, then consistency needs to be on point.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>I definitely like to be a do-it-yourself-er and haven’t had much opportunity to hand things off to other people; though I’m not opposed at all to working in a team, especially if it will aid int eh growth of my business.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>One more note, I like to be able to pick up and put down my work when I need to (flexibility).  I have no objections to going as hard or intensely as needed to get the job done, but I need refraction time or an off switch, or at least to not take the work home with me.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><strong>Question 7:</strong>  <em>What other skills, talents, and aptitudes do you have?</em></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>I already published the <a href="{% post_url 2020-09-24-change-maker-abilities %}">abilities worksheet</a> and I think that pretty well covered my “intangible” abilities.  I think having a background in mental health definitely lends itself to other human service professions; not just in terms of implementing behavioral change, but being able to have (difficult if needed) conversations with people.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>I’m also a very transparent and genuine person.  A lot of people brag that “what you see is what you get” and that “they’re the same person in the office as they are in their living room.”  I don’t bother to tell people this, I let them figure it out.  In general I try to keep my “professional self” classy, but I certainly don’t pull any punches.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><strong>Bonus:</strong>  <em>When you retire or die, how will you know whether you’ve followed your purpose?</em></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>With the terror of death setting in I’ll be able to force a smile and <em>“Damn, I’m glad I did….”</em> rather than lament <em>“I wish I had….”</em></p>
