I"s<p>In a previous (observational) study I concluded the importance of sleep and it’s effect on recovery, but specifically the effect of a dedicated routine on sleep quality.</p>

<p>Since recording this video I have changed a few things.  I have moved the yoga / stretching to my morning routine.  The reason for this is that it’s an easy substitute for my morning lifting routine depending on if I need a “rest” day or not.  At night though, I have added a a cold shower or an ice pack on my neck while I’m reading.  In the same study (referenced below) I concluded that cold showers weren’t particularly helpful for recovery (why is discussed in the article).  So, this isn’t what you might think – to reduce swelling / lactic acid / DOMS – it’s actually to try and lower my body temperature.  Even a few tenths of a degree seems to help me sleep better overall.</p>
