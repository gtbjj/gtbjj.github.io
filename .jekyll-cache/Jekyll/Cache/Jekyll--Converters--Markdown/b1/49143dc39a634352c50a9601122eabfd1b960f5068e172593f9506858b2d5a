<h4 id="news---kernel-specific">News - Kernel Specific:</h4>

<p><strong>Faux Audio Support:</strong> Feature has been removed as the patch I used to implement it was breaking builds after I switched to Franco Kernel as a base.</p>

<p><strong>Fingerprint Scanner:</strong>  The ‚Äúpatch‚Äù I was using to implement this improvement (increasing wakelock after interrupt) was based in a commit message (from Flash Kernel I believe), however, restoring the changed lines in <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">drivers/input/fingerprint/fpc1020_tee.c</code>.</p>

<p><strong>CopperheadOS / Franco Kernel:</strong>  The <a href="https://github.com/AndroidHardeningArchive/kernel_huawei_angler">previous repositories on GitHub</a> have been renamed under a new organization (Android Hardening vs. CopperheadOS) and, for Angler, is now missing several  branches and the last commit is dated <em>September 26, 2017</em>.  There is <a href="https://github.com/CopperheadOS/kernel_huawei_angler">a new set of CopperheadOS repositories</a> that an initial commit was pushed to for Angler in early July.  As Such I‚Äôve rebased my kernel to <a href="https://github.com/franciscofranco/angler">Francisco Fraco‚Äôs Franco Kernel</a> as it is one of a shrinking number of kernels that are still actively maintained (as of June 2018) for the Nexus 6P.</p>

<p><strong>Linux Stable:</strong>  Previously I was having issues where merging the <a href="https://github.com/android-linux-stable/angler">Android Linux Stable upstream from GitHub</a> was breaking my builds.  However, I followed <a href="https://github.com/android-linux-stable/notes/blob/master/process/how-to.md">android-linux-stable‚Äôs instructions</a> to manually fetch / merge directly from the <a href="https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/stable/linux.git/">Linux upstream</a>.  I elected to use the <em>merge</em> rather than <em>cherry-pick</em> method.  Franco Kernel appeared to already be up to date with Linux 3.10.108.</p>

<p><strong>Security Patches:</strong>  At the time of writing Franco Kernel has not yet been patched with the July security patch.  Fortunately, I learned to do this myself with the following steps:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Check the <a href="https://android.googlesource.com/kernel/msm/+refs">msm kernel branch tags</a> for the tag that has the most recent security patch.  For refernece, July 2018‚Äôs patch tag is <a href="https://android.googlesource.com/kernel/msm/+/android-8.1.0_r0.80">android-8.1.0_r0.80</a>.</li>
  <li>The beginning of the tag‚Äôs commit mesage with include A) the device name (angler) and the B) the build branch (e.g. OPM6.171019.030.E1).</li>
  <li>Check the <a href="https://developers.google.com/android/images#angler">list of factory images</a> to see that the bulid branch matches the month‚Äôs release you‚Äôre looking for.  (e.g. ‚Äò8.1.0 (OPM6.171019.030.E1, Jul 2018)‚Äô)</li>
  <li>Use either the <em>cherry-pick</em> or <em>merge</em> methods mentioned in the <a href="https://github.com/android-linux-stable/notes/blob/master/process/how-to.md">linux-stable guide</a>.</li>
</ul>

<h4 id="news---non-kernel-specific">News - Non-Kernel Specific:</h4>

<p><strong>Jump to Camera:</strong> I noticed a while back that, even on the stock ROM, double clicking the power button was not jumping to the camera ‚Äì which is one of my favorite features.  I first suspected that it was error / mismatching vendor.img, but it turns out that there is a hidden setting that is apparently off by default.  <em>Fix:</em>  Go to <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">settings</code> and search for <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">jump to camera</code> and enable.  Boomsy!</p>

<p><strong>Random Battery Shutdowns:</strong>  I tried several solutions from around the web (<a href="https://forum.xda-developers.com/nexus-6p/general/guide-fix-nexus-6p-bootloop-death-blod-t3640279">here</a> and <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Nexus6P/comments/67y45a/yesterday_my_6p_shut_off_at_25_today_it_shut_off/dgudndw/">here</a>) that did not work.  <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Nexus6P/comments/681v42/early_shutdown_bug_temporary_fix/">One proposed solution</a> to ‚Äúrecalibrate‚Äù the battery in conjunction with restoring to the latest stock factory images at least got me reliably below 50% when my device was dying sometimes as high as 60+%.  If you‚Äôve been snooping around <a href="https://github.com/savagesen/anykernel">my anykernel repo</a> since the last kernel release, I was experimenting with disabling the Big CPU cores as well as nerfing a bunch of other things to try and reduce the overall CPU load.  I‚Äôve since done a hard reset on that repo as those profiles did not provide significant changes.</p>

<h4 id="to-do">To-DO:</h4>

<ul>
  <li>I will run new performance benchmarks now for the old Battery v1.3 and Balance v1.2 spectrum profiles.</li>
  <li>The <em>zen</em> I/O Scheduler will be added.</li>
  <li>I will test some of the <em>minor</em> changes (animation scale and vibration strength) that were made to <em>nerfed</em> spectrum proiles mentioned above.</li>
</ul>
