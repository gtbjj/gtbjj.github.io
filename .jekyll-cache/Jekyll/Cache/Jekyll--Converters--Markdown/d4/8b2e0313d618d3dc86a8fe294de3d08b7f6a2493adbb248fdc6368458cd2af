I"I<p>There are dozens of nutrition related certifications out there.  How do you chose the one that’s best for you?  While dietitians require a license in the state they practice, the term “nutritionist” isn’t as tightly regulated.  Similarly, counseling requires a license, but “therapist” does not.  Obviously there’s room for some sketchy interpretation of ethics and scope of practice there – don’t get me start on <em>“life coaches”</em>.</p>

<p>However, that’s not what this post is about.  The certification I settled on was <a href="https://www.precisionnutrition.com/">Precision Nutriton</a> and I got a message on Instagram asking what made me choose that particular certification.</p>

<h3 id="reason-1">Reason #1</h3>

<p><strong>They are repeatedly recognized as one of the top certification programs.</strong></p>

<p>Secretary of States (or rather their professional licensing boards) regulate licenses.  There’s no such verification of of “certifications.”  So, how much is a certification worth?  Whatever people agree it’s worth.  If I host <em>Austin’s 2-day Keto Workshop</em>, then print out a certificate at the end and declare every <em>“Keto Coach Certified”</em>, that doesn’t mean a whole lot.</p>

<p>In contrast, when you’ve been recognized by <em>Time Magazine, The New York Times</em>, the <em>San Antonio Spurs</em>, and the <em>Carolina Panthers</em> you’ve gained some clout.  On top of that, if you Google “best nutrition certification”, PN is features in 4 of the first 5 results. Solid.</p>

<h3 id="reason-2">Reason #2</h3>

<p><strong>The price was right.</strong></p>

<p>A vetted certification comes at a price.  Some functional medicine training programs will run you $2,000 - $4,000.  I wasn’t looking to take out another student loan, just vet myself and make sure I know what I think I know and earn the credentials to show it (see above).</p>

<p>At the time I registered, PN was offering a zero-down promotion.  When your first payment isn’t due for 30 days, you’ve got a timetable to finish the course (I actually did it in 3 weeks, early).  Therein you get to <em>“try it before you buy it.”</em>  Even if you don’t finish the course in the first month, you can get pretty deep into it (if you don’t then there’s a big message for you to turn around!).  You’ll be able to tell if the content is too complicated or too simple, if the authors’ MO jives with yours, or if you’re really even serious about certification.</p>

<p>After the first 30 days you make monthly payments rather than a flat fee.  This is convenient for me as well because it gives me a fair and modest earnings quota for my “side hustle.”  The bill keeps me accountable to remain diligent in this process.</p>

<h3 id="reason-3">Reason #3</h3>

<p><strong>Our values aligned.</strong></p>

<p>As I started into the program, I loved that PN approaches health from a multifaceted perspective (there is a video in <a href="https://t.me/kombatkitchen">our Telegram group</a> taking about “the wheel of health / deep health”).  If you have ready any of <a href="https://kombat-kitchen.square.site/">the Kombat Kitchen e-books</a> then you know this is something I’m adamant about as well.  The video referenced above also discusses the differences between my viewpoint / categorization of the facets of “deep health” and PNs.</p>

<p>Simply put, the same 6 components (physical, social, existential, cognitive, environmental, and emotional) are all covered, they’re just categorized differently in Kombat Kitchen (mental, social, physical, nutritional health).</p>

<p>I also like their categorization of clients (level 1, 2, and 3).  Again, Kombat Kitchen is broken down into “belt” levels as well.  Similar to PN’s “level 1”, Kombat Kitchen’s “white belt” (and “blue belt”) is a fundamentals-first type of program that is written for the very beginning of beginners, yet could still yield great benefits for recreational athletes as well.  Obviously you wouldn’t approach all clients the same, hence the distinction in PN levels and the multiple Kombat Kitchen books of varying complexity and detail.</p>

<h3 id="reason-4">Reason #4</h3>

<p><strong>They include guidance about the business side of thing.</strong></p>

<p>In my opinion, learning the science of nutrition is the easy part.  There’s a multitude of good (and crappy) resources online ranging from blogs to podcasts to YouTube channels, etc.  What’s much harder for a lot of people is that coaching isn’t just dispensing facts, it’s changing behavior (interpreted loosely regarding the above categories).</p>

<p>I have been practicing counseling for over 5 years and have worked in health care for almost 10.  <em>I’m not everyone’s “cup of tea”</em>, but I’d say I have a pretty good understanding of how imperative the relational process of human services is.  So, what I really needed help with was the business component (again, they don’t teach you this when you’re in graduate school for counseling / psychology either).</p>

<p>While the business side of things is only one chapter in the certification course, there is an entirely separate book included – <a href="https://amzn.to/33QD8dg">John Berardi’s Change Maker</a>.  Which is explicitly about the entrepreneurship process and path to success.</p>

<h3 id="reason-5">Reason #5</h3>

<p><strong>The production value is excellent.</strong></p>

<p>I won’t lie.  Branding matters.  The content labeling was super slick.  On top of that the study materials were high quality – imagine paying tens of hundreds of dollars for a few flimsy pamphlets!  The supplemental videos were incredibly well done as well for visual learners (I include myself in this group).  The videos gave enough information to provide an apt summary, but you still had to read the book chapters to pass the test.</p>

<p>There you have it!  The top five reasons I selected Precision Nutrition certification program above others.  I am also on the pre-sale mailing list for PN2, which only opens twice per year and is a 12-month long process to complete.</p>
