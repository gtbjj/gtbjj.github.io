  <li>What do you want to backup?

      <p>This probably includes you personal data (pictures, music, 
documents, etc‚Ä¶) as well as essential system configurations (<a href="https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/System_backup_and_reinstall">See the 
Arch Wiki for a rundown of 
this</a>)</p>

  </li>
  <li>Where do you want it to go (from where, how often)?</li>
  <li>How are you gonna get it there (local storage, cloud, home-based server, 
automatic, incremental)?
    <blockquote>
      <p>I prefer to have bot ‚Äúlocal‚Äù and ‚Äúremote‚Äù options.  That is, one 
backup in case I screw someting up (local) and another (remote) in case 
the house burns down or something.</p>
    </blockquote>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>Here I‚Äôm going to go over a simple 3-way backup solution featuring a host 
(pc), a remote (Android phone), and cloud (Google Drive).  I wrote <a href="https://gtbjj.github.io/linux/2016/02/20/Syncthing.html">an 
earlier post about 
Syncthing</a> and 
you can get a general idea there.  I‚Äôm also going to assume you‚Äôve read 
the <a href="http://docs.syncthing.net/intro/getting-startehttps://docs.syncthing.net/users/ignoring.htmld.html">Syncthing ‚ÄòGet Started 
Guide‚Äô</a>.</p>

<h3 id="step-1-remote--host">Step 1 (Remote &gt; Host)</h3>

<p><img style="float: right; height: auto; width: 40%" src="http://drive.google.com/uc?exportview&amp;id=0B2RH_BSaD6YPbzMyRHh2S0NORW8" /></p>

<p>On your phone you‚Äôll want to install <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=org.openintents.filemanager">a file manager app (such as 
OI)</a> 
for this step and get 
<a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.yottajoy.gdrive">GDriveSync</a> 
for later.  Open the <em>syncthing</em> on your phone and configure the files you 
want to share with your Linux machine.</p>

<p>You want to avoid duplicating data, so read <a href="https://docs.syncthing.net/users/ignoring.html">Syncthing‚Äôs documention on 
ignoring files / folders</a>.<br />
In the setup above, <em>phone_storage</em> is the root of my phone (which is the 
folder‚Äôs master) and linked to my pc, thus backing up my phones media and 
documents.  Simple enough.</p>

<p>However, I want some of that media to acessible on my pc rather than 
burried in the file tree (e.g. <em>~/music</em> rather than 
<em>~/phone/storage/emulated/0/Music</em>).  So, the exceptions I have configured 
are for <em>/storage/emulated/0/{Music,Pictures,Downloads,pc_backup}</em>  (See 
below about <em>pc_backup</em>.  I created separate folder links for these (to 
<em>~/downloads ~/music ~/pictures</em> respectively) and made the phone the 
<em>master</em> for them as well since I do much more dowloading, music 
listening, and picture taking there anyhow.</p>

<h3 id="step-2-host--remote">Step 2 (Host &gt; Remote):</h3>

<p>Next, fire up <em>Syncthing</em> on your Linux computer:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><code class="highlighter-rouge">$ systemctl --user start syncthing</code></p>
</blockquote>

<p>On your phone, use the file manager app you downloaded to create a folder 
that you want to sync your pc to (e.g. <em>/storage/emulated/0/pc_backup</em>).<br />
Configure <em>Syncthing</em> to linke your home directory (<em>/home/user_name</em>) to 
the folder you created on the phone‚Äôs internal storage.</p>

<p>Just like above you‚Äôll want to configure some exceptions so that you‚Äôre 
not duplicating date.  The list will probably be the same.  For example, I 
don‚Äôt want the backups of my phone (stored on my computer) being included 
when my computer backs up to my  phone.</p>

<p>With the app and server running, things should be chugging away nicely 
though they will take a good bit of time for the initial sync.</p>

<h3 id="step-3-remote--cloud">Step 3 (Remote &gt; Cloud):</h3>

<p><img style="float: right; height: auto; width: 40%" src="http://drive.google.com/uc?exportview&amp;id=0B2RH_BSaD6YPY01hWFJKVWh0Rlk" /></p>

<p>Open the <em>GDriveSync</em> app and connect the appropriate Google account.  Tap 
the <em>+</em> button on the bottom left of the screen, then ‚Äú<em>select</em>‚Äù (we want 
to be using <em>/storage/emulated/0</em>).</p>

<p>For the Google Drive folder selection, create a folder called 
<em>phone_backup</em> (this will also include a backup of your pc since it is 
synced to your phone).  Then select ‚Äú<em>Two Way Sync - Upload</em>‚Äù.  This is 
the same thing as checking ‚Äúmaster‚Äù in Syncthing when you want the phone‚Äôs 
data to have discretion over the destination.</p>

<p><em>GDriveSync</em> also has options for configuring automatic backups and 
syncing over WiFi only, which are both very good ideas in this case.</p>

<h3 id="bonus">Bonus:</h3>

<p>You may want to backup more than just <em>/home</em>.  What do you absolutely 
need to backup?  I‚Äôve found the simplest and effective way to be the Arch 
Wiki  link posted in the introduction.</p>

<p>What do you need to backup?</p>
<ul>
  <li>System settings (/etc)</li>
  <li>Packages (/var/cache/pacman/pkg/*)</li>
  <li>Personal data (/home)</li>
</ul>

<p>We‚Äôve already covered the last bullet, so let‚Äôs look at the others.<br />
Firstly, consider the amount of storage you have available on your phone.<br />
If you have copious amounts of storage, then you could <em>rsync</em> copies of 
<em>/etc</em> and <em>/var/cache/pacman/pkg</em> to <em>~/home/use/r</em>, but it saves storage 
space and takes marginally more effort to restore if you use <em>tar</em> and 
<em>pacman</em> respectively.</p>

<p>To backup system settings, run:</p>

<p><code class="highlighter-rouge">$ sudo XZ_OPT=-9 tar -cjf /home/user/etc.tar.xz /etc</code></p>

<p>For a list of installed packages from the official repository, run:</p>

<p><code class="highlighter-rouge">$ pacman -Qqe | grep -v "$(pacman -Qqm)" &gt; /home/user/pkglist.off</code></p>

<p>For a list of unofficial packages installed on your system, do:</p>

<p><code class="highlighter-rouge">$ pacman -Qqm &gt; /home/user/pkglist.aur</code></p>

<p>Creating a <a href="https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/cron">cron</a> job with 
these commands allows us to automate the process.</p>

<h3 id="conclusion">Conclusion:</h3>

<p>The important things to backup are A) system settings, B) installed 
programs, and C) personal data.  Also, <em>one backup is <strong>never</strong> enough</em>.<br />
Ideally backups should be incremental (which those in this tutorial are 
not) and accomodate different potential for data loss (e.g. theft, fire, 
user error).  The process covered here looks like this when finished:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Phone uses <em>Syncthing</em> to backup internal storage to pc</li>
  <li>PC uses <em>Syncthing</em> to backup user‚Äôs /home, a copy of system settings, 
and list of installed packages to phone‚Äôs internal storage</li>
  <li>Phone uses <em>GDriveSync</em> to send a copy of phone‚Äôs internal storage 
(including backup content sent from pc to phone) to Google Drive.</li>
</ul>
