I"Ñ<p><em>Itâ€™s been a busy holiday season on the road or sure and there is a lot to 
talk about.  As such, Iâ€™ve decided to break the past three weeks down into 
two separate posts.  This one will be â€œlighterâ€ and feature all the basic 
climber / dirtbag / wanderlust things; while the â€œdark roastâ€ will get a 
bit gritty and existential.  This way reader of both can enjoy each 
separately, or togetherâ€¦ like coffee, a perfect Shot-in-the-Dark.</em></p>
