<ul>
  <li>What do you want to backup?
    <blockquote>
      <p>This probably includes you personal data (pictures, music, 
documents, etc‚Ä¶) as well as essential system configurations (<a href="https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/System_backup_and_reinstall">See the 
Arch Wiki for a rundown of 
this</a>)</p>
    </blockquote>
  </li>
  <li>Where do you want it to go (from where, how often)?</li>
  <li>How are you gonna get it there (local storage, cloud, home-based server, 
automatic, incremental)?
    <blockquote>
      <p>I prefer to have bot ‚Äúlocal‚Äù and ‚Äúremote‚Äù options.  That is, one 
backup in case I screw someting up (local) and another (remote) in case 
the house burns down or something.</p>
