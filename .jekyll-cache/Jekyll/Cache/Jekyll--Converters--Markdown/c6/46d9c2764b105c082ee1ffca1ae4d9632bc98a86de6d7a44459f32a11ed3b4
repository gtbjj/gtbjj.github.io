I"Ò<p>First we looked at <a href="/posts/carnivore-90-day-review-01/">caffeine and performance</a>, then <a href="/posts/carnivore-90-day-review-02/">cold showers and recovery</a>.  There were some other things that came to my attention that I wanted to look at as well.  These included the relationship between Fat:Protein ratio and blood sugar and ketones.  I also wanted to include a follow up study to my previous pilot on electrolytes and cardiovascular load.</p>
