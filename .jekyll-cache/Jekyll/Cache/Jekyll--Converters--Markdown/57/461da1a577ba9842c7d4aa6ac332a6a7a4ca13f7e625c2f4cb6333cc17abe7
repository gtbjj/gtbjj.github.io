I"“<p>I recently rooted my Nexus 6P and, of course, instantly began searching for â€œthe best ROM.â€  As mentioned before, Iâ€™ve been 
out of the root game for several years, but Iâ€™m going on the assumption that any ROM that still has an active thread on the XDA Developer 
Forums has a fairly prolific feature list.  Basically, theyre all probably pretty good and there are dozens to choose from.</p>
