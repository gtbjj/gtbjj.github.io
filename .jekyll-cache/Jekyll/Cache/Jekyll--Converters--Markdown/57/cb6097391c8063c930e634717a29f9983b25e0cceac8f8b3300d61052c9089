I"‘<h3 id="gear">Gear</h3>

<p>While itâ€™s easy to do I dropped a small fortune at REI about a week ago to upgrade my backpacking and camping gear, but they let me keep my kidneys and the gear is great, so itâ€™s a win-win.  To make this short and sweet I decided it was time for me to take the plunge and really go <code class="highlighter-rouge">all in</code> on good camping gear if I was really going to commit to the dirtbag lifestyle.</p>

<p>My tent was just old, heavy, and way way way worn out, and I had always slept on an old foamy sleeping pad.  Iâ€™m going to make some shameless promotional plugs here, but I found myself extremely satisfied with my purchases.  The tent is super light and for one person itâ€™s cozy but not cramp (Iâ€™m a short and stout build) and the sleeping pad is â€“ not exaggerating â€“ <code class="highlighter-rouge">at least as good, if not better</code> than any mattress Iâ€™ve ever slept on.  The pillow and pad are bomber also.  So, if youâ€™re looking to outfit yourself with some mid-high range camping / backpacking gear that is light, compact, gets the job done, and wonâ€™t require a second mortgage, hereâ€™s my list:</p>

<h3 id="guests">Guests</h3>

<p>If youâ€™ve taken a look at <a href="https://instagram.com/southeastdirtbag">my Instagram</a> lately then you know that I had <a href="https://instagram.com/p/6s8im-wDku/?taken-by=southeastdirtbag">an unexpected overnight guest</a> last night.  I woke up about 1:30 a.m. and there was a scurry out of my tent and a scratch on my leg (naughty pic required, so no public posting).  It was kind of bizarre since Iâ€™m no rookie outdoorsman and of course didnâ€™t have any food in my tent.  The rain fly door was actually opened, but apparently one of <a href="http://www.walkingmountains.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/Raccoon-1.jpg">these fellers</a> wanted to cuddle up on my lap.  Though, since he didnâ€™t want to use the door he decided to shred the bug net on my tent on the way in / out.</p>

<p><em>As a quick side note to this story</em> I want to give a shout out to my humanoid guests, friends, and companions whoâ€™ve come out to visit and climb with me.  Thank you for making this journey much more pleasurable.</p>

<p>I suspect that someone has been leaving food around campsites and my furry friend has now learned to associate those soft dome-like structures we call tents with food-finding.  At any rate, no harm no foul really.  I havenâ€™t talked to anyone from REI yet, but Iâ€™m obligated to give a shout out to <a href="http://www.nemoequipment.com/">NEMO Equipment</a> not only for having awesome gear, but also awesome customer service.  Within 5 - 10 minutes of my posting the encounter pic to Instagram I had an email from them.  Hats off to you gents!</p>
