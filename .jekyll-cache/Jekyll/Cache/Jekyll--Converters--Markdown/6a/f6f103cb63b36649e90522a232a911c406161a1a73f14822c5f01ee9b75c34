<p>The Stranger Raiden met at the end of the Training Day event leads him to a dark warehouse.  He tells Raiden that <em>“Stark is no friend of mine either, but I have an enemy I’d like to have your assistance against.”</em>  He offers Raiden a mechanical / cybernetic upgrade that enhances his strength.</p>

<p>Raiden notices that The Stranger will frequently have ticks and make comments as if he’s talking to another person inside his head, but also elsewhere in the room.</p>

<p>Raiden starts to walk away, stating he’s <em>done fighting other people’s battles</em>; but The Stranger says; “<em>The real question is, what do you have against our common enemies?”</em></p>

<p>Raiden’s interest is peaked, so he stays.  The Stranger says he <em>“has spies all over</em>” and asks one to <em>“come out of hiding.”</em>  Raiden’s cybernetic sense que him off to something behind him.  He jumps out of the way as Carnage (BR12) emerges from the shadows.</p>

<p>Carnage tries to intimidate Raiden, but he is unafraid; but anxious and attacks the creature.  He lands a massive blow with his sword.  Carnage retaliates with an equally heavy blow, catching Raiden in his tentacles.</p>

<p>Just then, Spider-Man (BR88) breaks through the window.  Carnage turns his attention to him and lands a glancing blow.  Raiden swings his sword to free himself, but Carnage traps the sword in another tentacle.  Next, Spider-Man fires a web ball that barely misses Carnage.  However, Raiden is able to regain control of his sword and slash himself free.</p>

<p>Suddenly, the roof of the buiilding explodes and is engulfed in flames as the Green Goblin (<a href="http://marvelheroicrp.wikia.com/wiki/Green_Goblin_(Norman_Osborn,_Watcher_Datafile)">data file</a>) flies over head.  Raiden notices The Stranger is not in the room and Spider-Man says that he had tracked the Green Goblin here.</p>

<p>Carnage attacks Raiden for slashing him.  The hit stresses Raiden out, but a burning rafter falls on Carnage.  Spider-Man rifles through the boxes in the room and finds an electrolyte pack to recharge Raiden.  Raiden is then able to attack and subdue Carnage with a heavy blow.</p>

<p>With Carnage incapacitated, Raiden and Spider-Man quickly look around the burning buidling.  Spider-Man notices a back door, but a pile of burning debris falls in front of it.  The two are easily able to clear the debris before Raiden slashes through the door itself.</p>

<p>The door leads to a testing lab (already engulfed in flames) that appears to be a breeding ground for <em>“goblin soldiers”</em>, or cyborgs of some kind.  However, the building quickly begins to cave in and the two flea the scene.</p>
