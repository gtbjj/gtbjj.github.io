<p>Growing tired of my Verizon bill, I did some 
looking into <a href="fi.google.com">Google‚Äôs Project Fi</a>.  As of 
this writing Google‚Äôs MVNO combining Sprint, T-Mobile, and 
WiFi networks is still invitation only.  I requested such 
an invitation and a few days later Google obliged the 
request.</p>

<p>After 
about a week of weighing the pros and cons I decided 
that even with footing the bill for a <a href="https://store.google.com/product/nexus_6p">Huawei Nexus 
6p</a> and my early 
termination fee from Verizon (yet to be confirmed), I‚Äôd 
still save a couple hundred dollars over the next two 
years.  <strong>That won‚Äôt change your life, but if I cut  you a 
check for $100 on the first of the year for no reason, 
you‚Äôd probably enjoy it.</strong>  True enough, I <del>am</del> would be 
elligible for a free upgrade from Verizon in late 
September, but I‚Äôm not convinced Samsung or LG are going to 
offer anything that takes the Nexus 6p out of the ‚Äúbest 
flagship debate.‚Äù</p>

<p>There 
are a lot of benchmark and stat comparisons on the 
web already (<a href="https://www.androidpit.com/samsung-galaxy-s6-edge-plus-vs-nexus-6p-comparison">vs SGS6 
Edge+</a> 
and <a href="http://www.androidcentral.com/nexus-6p-versus-iphone-6s-plus">vs iPhone 
6s+</a>), 
but benchmarks have long since lost their relevance with 
the never ending hardware race and all.  Not to mention the 
need for more power to push through all that bloatware 
(*cough!)   That said, I‚Äôve already started collecting data 
on my, by now archaic, <a href="http://www.androidcentral.com/nexus-6p-versus-iphone-6s-plus">HTC One 
Remix</a> 
to compare service coverage.  I‚Äôll also plan on collecting 
real world usage stats (battery, coverage, data 
speed, etc‚Ä¶) on <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1LRLNCjorZRZhR7dXDEX930pN1qOU0WpHueKJNh1zFOU/edit?usp=sharing">a 
publicly shared Google Drive 
spreadsheet</a>.</p>

<p>To say the least, I‚Äôm pretty excited!  Not only am I 
getting a <strong>HUGE</strong> upgrade in hardware, but I always get 
a little giddy when I get a chance to ‚Äú<em>stick it to the 
man</em>.‚Äù  Thanks to a couple useful reviews of Project Fi 
from <a href="http://www.engadget.com/2015/12/04/google-project-fi/">this article on 
Engadget</a> 
and <a href="http://www.androidcentral.com/project-fi-isnt-me-yet-its-still-really-good">this one on Android 
Central</a> 
I decided that I met the criteria for the benefiting / 
target audioence (single line, low data usage).</p>

<p><strong><em>Most of all I‚Äôm exciteded to hop back on XDA and go root 
wild again!</em></strong>  (Yes, that‚Äôs another stab at Verizon for 
locking boot loaders ‚Äî might as well mention the lack of 
hotspot functionality too!).</p>
