I"N<p><em>Please complete the instructions an <a href="/posts/nexus6p-rooting/">Part I</a> before continuing below.</em></p>

<p><strong>Proceed at your own risk.</strong></p>

<p>1) Download the <a href="https://dl.twrp.me/angler/">latest version of TWRP</a> to your computer.</p>

<p>2) Boot to your phone’s boot loader either with the physical buttons or ADB.</p>

<p>3) Check that fastboot is working (<code class="highlighter-rouge">$ fastboot devices</code>), and flash the recovery image:</p>

<p><code class="highlighter-rouge">$ fastboot flash recover /path/to/twrp-&lt;version&gt;.angler.img</code></p>

<p>4) On your phone:  use the volume buttons to scroll to <em>Reboot Bootloader</em>, then scroll to and select <em>Recovery Mode</em>.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Just a special mention here that WOW, these things have come a long ways in the last few years!  A clock, temperature, and battery status all in the recovery mode, not to mention touch support! I’m sure they’ve been around for a while, but I’m a bit out of the game.  At any rate, nice work TWRP Team!</p>
</blockquote>

<p>5) Swipte to allow modifications.</p>

<p>6) Remember, you should have already disable the security features of your phone so that you can be able to access backups in the future.  That 
said, tap <em>Backup</em> on TWRP’s home screen.  The first backup you make should contain that <em>system, data, boot, vendor</em> checkboxes.  Swipe to 
continue – it will take a few minutes to complets, so maybe start browsing which ROM you’ll flash first.</p>

<p>7) Make a separate backup of the <em>EFS</em> section.  This contains your phone’s MEI which basically authenticates your number, carrier, phone 
status, and the lowest level essentials.  Screwing this up may be impossible to recover from.  <strong>So back it up now.</strong></p>
