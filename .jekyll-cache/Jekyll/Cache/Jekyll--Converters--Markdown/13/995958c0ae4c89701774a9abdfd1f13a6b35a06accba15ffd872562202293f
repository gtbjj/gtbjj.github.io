I"€	<p>One of the most insightful things I read prior to beginning life as a dirtbag was to not let climbing become a job for you, or to treat it like one rather.  The idea  being that if you feel like you <code class="highlighter-rouge">have to climb</code> every day simply because you can, then you‚Äôre on the fast track to having all the love sucked out of it.</p>

<p>A few days ago I was headed ‚Äúhome‚Äù to <a href="http://www.mountainproject.com/v/rocktown/106036120">Rocktown</a> / <a href="http://www.mountainproject.com/v/lost-wall/105900335">Lost Wall</a> and stopped off at an exit for gas when I felt a drudging ‚ÄúUgh!‚Äù in my mind when I felt I <em>*had to*</em> go that way.  I gave in to the impulse desire of saying; <code class="highlighter-rouge">"Screw it, I'm not any further from Chattanooga than I am from Rocktown.  What the hell is the point of being a dirtbag if you feel tied to any one place?!"</code></p>

<p>So I logged some nice solo  morning sessions self-belaying at <a href="http://www.mountainproject.com/v/sunset-park/105888070">Sunset Park</a>.  I  must say, relaxing in the park in the downtown ‚ÄòNooga area across the river from the aquarium was a hell of a lot nicer way to spend the evenings than anything I might have done in LaFayette after a day of climbing.  <code class="highlighter-rouge">Worth it!</code></p>

<p>What‚Äôs more is that I only ticked five climbs in three days.  Now, part of that is because this was a mid-week excursion and technically I do have a full-time job to attend to.  (However, the 2nd-ish shift schedule keeps my mornings pretty open).  There is just a different mindset that is learned with dirtbagging.  In weekend warrior mode you might try to pack as many climbs into a weekend as you possibly can, climb until your fingers fall off, and then spend Monday - Friday recovering or maybe logging a few hangboard sessions.</p>

<p>That attitude simply doesn‚Äôt cut it dirtbagging for the reasons mentioned above.  Today I spent at much time setting up and rappelling as I did climbing and two or three times as much time hiking as I did climbing.  But the climb (<a href="http://www.mountainproject.com/v/stans-crack-direct-finish/105957468">Stan‚Äôs Carck Direct</a>) was excellent and I loved every minute of the morning.  If I was going to have to force myself to pack in more climbs simply ‚Äúbecause I‚Äôm there‚Äù then it‚Äôs not worth it and I need to take  a rest day to go sight seeing or some other shenanigans other than climbing.</p>
