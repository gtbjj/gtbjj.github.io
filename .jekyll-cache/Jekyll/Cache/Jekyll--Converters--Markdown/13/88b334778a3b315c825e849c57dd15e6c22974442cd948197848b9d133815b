I"À<p>Since I recently upgraded to a Nexus 6p I wanted to find a use for the 32 GB MicroSD card I was using in my old phone. Â Conveniently this is the same size as the X205TAâ€™s internal storage. Â Thinking what to do with this combination, I settled on configuring a RAID0 installation of Arch Linux since Iâ€™d never done that before. Â Doing so Â over MicroSD is also far more difficult to accidently remove or lose than a USB configuration.</p>
