<h4 id="news--boot-issues">News:  Boot Issues</h4>

<p>In my last release post, I published an update detailing boot issues dating as far back as the 201803 release.  Effected, non-booting versions include:</p>

<ul>
  <li>201803</li>
  <li>201804</li>
  <li>201805</li>
  <li>201806-sz-bal</li>
  <li>201806-sz-btr</li>
</ul>

<p><code class="highlighter-rouge">201806-fk</code> did boot, but init profiles / ramdisk changes were not being applied.  The more ‚Äúfixing‚Äù I did, the more breaking I did, so I completely reverted to the base <a href="https://github.com/osm0sis/AnyKernel2">AnyKernel2 by osm0sis</a> which brought my kernel‚Äôs packaging up to speed with the master repository. I then took a closer look at some of the Spectrum profiling process (below).</p>

<h4 id="news--franco-kernel-vs-copperheados">News:  Franco Kernel vs CopperheadOS</h4>

<p>I started building this kernel as a fork of CopperheadOS in order to prize security.  Technically I started as a fork of Flash Kernel, and moved to Copperhead after that kernel stopped development.  At any rate, a quick look at GitHub reveals the following most recent commits to the respective kernels‚Äô source code:</p>

<table>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td><a href="https://github.com/franciscofranco/angler">Franco Kernel</a></td>
      <td>4 days ago</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td><a href="https://github.com/android-linux-stable/angler">Linux Stable (angler)</a></td>
      <td>14 days ago</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td><a href="https://github.com/AndroidHardening/kernel_huawei_angler">CopperheadOS</a></td>
      <td><strong>9 months ago</strong></td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

<p>9 monts?!  That is frustrating when Nexus / Pixel lines are getting monthly security updates already ‚Äì though it looks like some individual files have been updated more recently for CopperheadOS.  There was a more recent branch in CopperheadOS‚Äôs GitHub (<code class="highlighter-rouge">oreo-m3-release</code>), though it seems their repositories have been redirected to <code class="highlighter-rouge">AndroidHardening</code> ‚Äì as you‚Äôll note if you clicked the link above.  However, that <code class="highlighter-rouge">oreo-m3-release</code> branch has since been deleted.</p>

<p>As such, I‚Äôm considering moving to Franco Kernel as a base since it is much mor eactively maintained.  That said, most of my work has taken place in the form of init profiles.  The actual kernel code changes were mostly cherry picked from the likes of‚Ä¶ you guessed it‚Ä¶ Franco, Flash, Electron, and a few other well established kernels.</p>

<h4 id="news--spectrum-profiles">News:  Spectrum Profiles</h4>

<p>I dug in to learn more about how Specturm (profiles) work and learned several things.</p>

<p>First, any profiles that are applied in the source code are overridden by the selection made in the <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=org.frap129.spectrum">Spectrum app</a> once the device reaches it‚Äôs userspace.</p>

<p>Second, I had never published instructions on how to contribute profiles my index.  I have mentioned in previous posts that it‚Äôs been my experience that applying these at boot time is more efficient than using a third party kernel monitoring appy to constantly check and apply the settings.  (instructions below)</p>

<p>Third, this effort to make kernel profiles scalable is somewhat overridden by the fact that <a href="https://forum.xda-developers.com/android/apps-games/app-spectrum-kernel-manager-users-t3601542">Spectrum Injector</a> is capable of loading profiles from your sdcard / internal storage.  Much the same, <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=org.frap129.kernelprofiler">a currently unreleased app</a> by the Spectrum developer(s) to load profiles from the userspace is available for beta testing in Google Play.  So, contributing more profiles to my source code may soon become futile.</p>

<p><em>Adding Profiles:</em>  I am very open to pull requests.  However, you should know that the Spectrum app only reads the frist four presents.  While the app names them ‚ÄúBalanced‚Äù, ‚ÄúPerformance‚Äù, ‚ÄúBattery‚Äù, and ‚ÄúGaming‚Äù you can of course name them whatever you‚Äôd like in the source code.  In theory you can set the profile in <a href="https://github.com/savagezen/anykernel/blob/angler-personal/ramdisk/init.spectrum.sh">init.spectrum.sh</a> file, however this does not seem to work as reliably as in previous versions.</p>

<p>If you‚Äôre still reading, then the benefit of doing this is that you don‚Äôt have to mess with ‚Äúheavy‚Äù coding of the kernel and can simply add your tweaks by:</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><table class="rouge-table"><tbody><tr><td class="rouge-gutter gl"><pre class="lineno">1
2
3
</pre></td><td class="rouge-code"><pre>$ git clone https://github.com/savagezen/anykernel
$ cd anykernel
$ git checkout angler-personal
</pre></td></tr></tbody></table></code></pre></div></div>

<p>From there, you can view <code class="highlighter-rouge">ramdisk/init.spectrum.sh</code> and change the numerical value on line 8 to the corresponding indexed profile you wish to use.  For convenience, all of the profiles in <code class="highlighter-rouge">init.spectrum.rc</code>.</p>

<p>Next, add your settings to <code class="highlighter-rouge">init.spectrum.rc</code>.  There are plenty of examples for you to learn to <code class="highlighter-rouge">write</code> the settings.  You will also need the <code class="highlighter-rouge">on property...</code> value to match the value listed in the index of <code class="highlighter-rouge">init.spectrum.sh</code>.  Again, remember, only the first four will be available to the app (e.g. can be switched in user space).</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><table class="rouge-table"><tbody><tr><td class="rouge-gutter gl"><pre class="lineno">1
2
3
</pre></td><td class="rouge-code"><pre># commented name of you and your profile
on property:persist.spectrum.profile=0
  write /path/to/setting value
</pre></td></tr></tbody></table></code></pre></div></div>

<p>Finally, zip it up and flash it!</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><table class="rouge-table"><tbody><tr><td class="rouge-gutter gl"><pre class="lineno">1
2
</pre></td><td class="rouge-code"><pre>$ rm *.zip    # removes last version
$ zip -r9 kernel-name.zip * -x README.md kernrel-name.zip
</pre></td></tr></tbody></table></code></pre></div></div>

<p><em>NOTE: Profiles from Flash Kernel require the Flash governor which has not been implemented yet.  The profiles exist for reference only.</em></p>
