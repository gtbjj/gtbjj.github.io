I"Ø<p>While on quarantine Iâ€™ve been diving deep into the weeks on a carnivore diet.  Though, as an aside, Iâ€™m very satisfied with my biomarkers and body composition (hypertension aside, but thereâ€™s much to say about that in conjunction with heart rate as well) and have been focusing my studies more on performance and recovery.  At any rate, it doesnâ€™t hurt to zoom out and survey the overall landscape once in a while.  That is, take a look at the big picture.</p>
