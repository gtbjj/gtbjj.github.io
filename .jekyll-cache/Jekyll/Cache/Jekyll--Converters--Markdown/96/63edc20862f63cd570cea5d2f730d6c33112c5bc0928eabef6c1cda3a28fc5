I"y<p>I recently got a copy of <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Controlled-Aggression-Girard-Bradshaw/dp/B005D2SAQ6/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1548425622&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=controlled+aggression">Controlled Aggression</a> by <a href="https://www.instagram.com/tarheelk9/">Jerry Bradshaw</a> which I’m very excited to start reading.  I’ve been a listener of the <a href="http://controlledaggressionpodcast.com/">Controlled Aggression Podcast</a> since it started.  As I work my way through the book I’m going to make summary posts of different chapters as reminders to myself and hope they can be of use to others as well.</p>
