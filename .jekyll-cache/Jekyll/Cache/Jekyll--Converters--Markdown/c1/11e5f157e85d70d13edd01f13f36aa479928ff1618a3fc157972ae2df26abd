I"³<p>It seems like Google is trying to phase out the personal library functionality of <a href="https://books.google.com/">the old Google Books</a> in favor of 
<a href="https://play.google.com/books">Google Play Books</a>.  Now, Google Play Books is pretty nice.  However, if youâ€™re like me, then you uploaded a 
hoard of PDFs to the old module which was especially nice since it didnâ€™t count towards your Google Drive storage.</p>
