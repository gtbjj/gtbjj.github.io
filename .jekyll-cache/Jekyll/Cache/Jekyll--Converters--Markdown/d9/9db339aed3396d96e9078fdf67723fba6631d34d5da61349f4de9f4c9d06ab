<p>Fall is coming to a close, and it‚Äôs staring to get rainy here in the south 
for the winter.  That means it‚Äôs a good time for reviewing the fall season 
before winter sets in in full and I start plugging gear in the depths of 
January.</p>

<p>I remember in the mid / late summer, August-ish, feeling really bummed 
that I (thought I) had hit a hard plateau.  Since that point I‚Äôve come a 
long way.  By any measure I had a dang good fall season.  How good?  In 
the last 90 days I:</p>

<ul>
  <li>relieved nealry all tendonitis in my elbows,</li>
  <li>lost about 8 pounds,</li>
  <li>train 1 - 2 hours <strong>less</strong> per week,</li>
  <li>raised my boulder highpoint by two grades,</li>
  <li>and repeated that problem.</li>
</ul>

<h4 id="how-is-this-possible">How is this possible?</h4>

<p>I can‚Äôt tell you that I have the magic training recipe or godlike 
genetics.  All I can say is that I‚Äôve racked up well over 200 ascents in 
2016 and kept a very detailed training log.  Perhaps  more importantly, 
I‚Äôve used that log to review, critique, analyze and adjust my training.</p>

<p>Specifically thoguht, there are a few major contributors that I think were 
key.</p>

<p>1) <strong>It starts before zero</strong>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Before I even began ‚Äútraining‚Äù this fall season, I had to come to terms that I had very severe tendonitis in my 
elbows.  However, for me this was on the opposite side of most climbers.<br />
That is, rather than over-crimping, I was over sloper-ing.  I took a whole 
month to readjust / correct / commit to A) shoulder mobility, B) hip 
flexibility, C) trigger point massages for my forearms, hands, and 
shoulders.  Each of these were practices 3-4 times per week.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>2) <strong>Assessing my performance</strong>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>(with something less arbitrary than an assigned grade).  A single grade is a terrible indicator of performance 
due to the dependence on style and not to mention the variability of 
weather.  After my recovery period I spent a couple weeks following 
R-Measure protocal, <a href="http://www.stevemaischtraining.com/on-becoming-self-aware-the-r-measure-and-you.html">described here by Steve 
Maisch</a>.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>3) <strong>Actually using my training log</strong>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>A training log is useless if you don‚Äôt use it (for assessment, and adjust accordingly).  Writing things 
down has limited value if you don‚Äôt go back and re-read it (at least for the purpose herein).  Once 
I had an indicator (above) of whether I needed to train maximum strength 
or power / strength endurance, I needed to read and assess my training 
logs so that I was actually improving the things I needed to work on.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>4) <strong>Getting serious about my weaknesses</strong>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>I have fat fingers and I‚Äôm a very stocky build by climber standards.  I used to complain about those 
facts before just accepting that I was going to have to deal with it.<br />
Literally, my fingers aren‚Äôt getting any smaller, and those micro crimps 
on ProblemX aren‚Äôt getting any bigger.  So, <em>do I want to keep 
complaining, or do I want to get sending?</em>  What is holding me back and 
what do I want to do about it?  There was a time when I was happy with 
where denial had gotten me, but that time has passed.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>5) <strong>Training smarter and harder</strong>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>I got focused about my training.  I no longer bounched ad hoc from random traning plans on the interwebs.  I 
researched training methods that would address the things I wanted to 
train.  I picked a few specific things to try really, really hard at.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>6) <strong>Training less</strong>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>I have referenced and read <a href="http://www.climbstrong.com/articles/20160427_1">Steve Bechtel‚Äôs piece on doing less</a> many times 
before.  Yet, it felt different as it really set into my bones and, more 
importantly, got acted upon and implemented in my training and at the 
crag.  This wasn‚Äôt rhetoric or (only) academic any more.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>7) <strong>A word on getting too serious</strong>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Not long ago I listened to the <a href="http://www.powercompanyclimbing.com/blog/2016/11/16/episode-17-process-vs-goal-based-motivation-with-arno-ilgner">Power Company Climbing podcast with Arno 
Ilgner</a> 
‚Äì which is just as awesome as you might imagine! ‚Äì and in the middle of 
this week I found myself having fallen into one of the traps Arno 
describes.  That is, I had become obsessed with a particular project and 
my entire thought process was wrapped up in the future ‚Äì all the rad 
stories and pictures I could share <em>after</em> sending.  All of that was 
sapping mental energy I could have been using <em>while actually climbing.</em></p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>Once I was able to let that go I took two days completely  off, got the 
project send on a third or fourth attempts, rested 10 minutes or so, set 
up the camera, and repeated it!</p>

<p>I‚Äôm not sure what the winter season or 2017 will hold, but it is a very 
exciting time in my climbing career.  It‚Äôs one of those rare, truly page 
turning moments where I‚Äôm left wondering, in a very optimistic way, <em>what 
am I really capable of?</em></p>

<p>I‚Äôm not hodling my breath to bump two more boulder grades in 2017, but one 
surely seems possible.  My current standing also makes me feel confident 
about being able to push hard on gear this coming winter, so perhaps there 
are some hearty gains to be made in that realm now.  Of course, there‚Äôs 
only one way to find out!</p>
