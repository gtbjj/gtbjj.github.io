<p>Creating custom / local Chrome Applications isn’t a novel concept.  However, using that information in conjunction with my Linux applications 
that use a browser-based front end; as well as a handy Chrome application (made by someone else) was new to me and I found it extremely 
convenient and useful.  Basically, the information isn’t new, but the process of putting all together was something I’d never thought of 
before.</p>

<h3 id="overview--web-apps-servers-and-bookmarks">Overview:  Web Apps, Servers, and Bookmarks</h3>

<p><strong>Web Apps</strong>:  Google Chrome’s ability to install browser-based applications means that they are essentially agnostic of the operating system 
they run on (given the dependency of chrome or one of its variants).  You probably spend a good deal of time in your browser anyway so lets 
make it a bit more practical.</p>

<p><strong>Servers</strong>:  If you’re a Linux user you probably make use of some server based apps, or apps that (can) run a web-base graphical user 
interface through your web browser.  What is actually happening here is that the app is runing a small local server on your home network.<br />
Examples include <a href="https://gtbjj.github.io/linux/backup%20and%20security/2016/02/20/Syncthing.html">Syncthing</a>, 
<a href="https://trac.transmissionbt.com/wiki/WebInterface">Transmission</a>, and <a href="https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/CUPS">CUPS printers</a>.</p>

<p><strong>Bookmarks</strong>:  Bookmarks, and their respective folders, are useful but it has been my experience they become more clutter than they’re worth.<br />
For somethings they are useful for archival purposes (e.g. I have a book mark folder for ‘to read’ news and journals and also a folder for 
recipes).  However, when it comes to technichal suppport some Google ninja skills usually find what I want faster than scowering through a, 
perhaps not even relevant now, pile of bookmarks.  At any rate, the above mentioned web apps / servers are usually atop my bookmark list so 
that I have quick access to them.</p>

<h3 id="the-new-tab-page">The ‘New Tab’ Page:</h3>

<p>There are apps in Chrome’s Webstore (<a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/show-apps-in-new-tab/nohbdifokmdgjcbbeobglcbaifinhfip?hl=en">such as this 
one</a>) that will change your ‘<em>new tab 
page</em>’ to the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">chrome://apps</code> page.  That eliminates a few clicks in and of itself when you open a new tab all your apps are right in front 
of you.  Just <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Ctl + T</code>, click, and you’re rolling.  There’s no scrolling through bookmark lists and no screen clutter (as with the 
browser’s bookmark bar itself), not to mention it will clear a few spaces in your said bookmark list.</p>

<h3 id="creating-custom-chrome-applications">Creating Custom Chrome Applications:</h3>

<p>There are several guides out there (<a href="http://www.howtogeek.com/169220/how-to-create-custom-chrome-web-app-shortcuts-for-your-favorite-websites/">such as this one from 
How-To-Geek</a>) that describe the 
sub-five-minute process of creating custom web apps.  The only caveats I found to such guides are that the <em>.pem</em> file needs to stay out of the 
root folder when you compile that app, and the icon image <em>must</em> be <em>.png</em> format.</p>

<h3 id="connecting-server-apps">Connecting Server Apps:</h3>

<p>This process is pretty straightforward and relies on the above linked guide:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Name and describe the application however you’d like.</li>
  <li>Google for an image icon (.png format) that you’re satisfied looking at every day.</li>
  <li>Change the web url to the local address your Linux app uses, something like <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">https://192.168.1.2</code> and add the port number if needed 
(such as for Syncthing -&gt; <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">https://localhost:8384</code>).</li>
  <li>Follow the necessary steps in the above guide.</li>
  <li>Install the chrome app liked above to set <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">chrome://apps</code> as your ‘<em>New Tab Page</em>.’</li>
  <li>Enjoy!</li>
</ol>
