<p>I started this post series to reflect on important moments in my jiu jitsu career â€“ both positive and negative.  Obviously, one of the biggest was returning to the sport after 5 1/2 years off (almost twice as long as I had been training).</p>

<p>I had been saving a draft titled <strong>â€œmotivation and memoriesâ€</strong> so, after rewatching the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tc7gXMs3lRw">Chewjitsu video on journals</a> I wanted to pull that content into a proper post.  First though, I mentioned my return to BJJ above, but I also want to note my first start in jiu jitsu.</p>

<p>The owner of that gym will always have a special place in my heart because at that time I was overweight, had some substance abuse problems from college, was out of a job, and had no way to pay gym dues.  Yet I mopped mats and helped with beginner boxing classes and we made things work.  To this day, I still stop by the gym when Iâ€™m in town and tell tales of yesteryear and build new memories with fresh up-and-comers with stories similar to mine.  Now, on to the present (or at least 2019)!</p>

<p>Hereâ€™s what I noted:</p>

<p>March:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Me: [hitting a heavy bag because no one showed up for open mat] and make a comment about doing 100 days in a row of jiu jitsu (even if itâ€™s just 5 minutes of solo drills at home)</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>Black Belt: â€œDo you think I take days off?  No!  And thatâ€™s why youâ€™re going to pass everyone around you.â€</p>
</blockquote>

<p>July:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Brown Belt:  [after rolling] â€œI canâ€™t mess around with you anymore becasue Iâ€™ll end up getting submitted.â€</p>
</blockquote>

<p>August:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>(different) Brown Belt:  I really like where your game is going.  I used to be able to submit you a couple times a round, now I cant even get one.â€</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>8/10/19: Earned third stripe on blue belt.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>December:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>(different) Black Belt: â€œ(Austin) is officially on my â€˜no playtimeâ€™ list nowâ€ [smiling and encouraging]</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>12/20/19: Earned fourth stripe on blue belt.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>January 2020:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>(different) Black Belt: [in front of class] â€œAustin, how long has it been since youâ€™ve competed?â€</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>Me: â€œProbably six years or so.â€</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>Black Belt: â€œYouâ€™re doing the world and this gym a disservice by not competing.  Youâ€™re literally giving away gold medals.â€</p>
</blockquote>

<p>February 2020:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>2/15/19:  Earned purple belt.</p>
