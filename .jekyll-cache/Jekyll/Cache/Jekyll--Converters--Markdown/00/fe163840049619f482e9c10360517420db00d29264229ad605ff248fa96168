I"Í<p>Finally!  <a href="/tabs/kombat_kitchen">#kombatkitchen</a> has launched.  Itâ€™s a special date for me because Iâ€™m celebrating 5 months as a carnivore!  Carnivory doesnâ€™t have anything to do with Kombat Kitchen (not directly anyway) and is in no way implied â€“ I just thought the synchronicity was nice.</p>

<p>Iâ€™ve released <a href="/tabs/kombat_kitchen">a series of short videos</a> describing in more detail what exactly Kombat Kitchen is as well as the philosophies and principles that founded and continue to drive it.</p>

<p>I will be adding to the series with FAQs so you can get all your â€œaboutâ€ and â€œFAQâ€ information in the same place!  You donâ€™t have to scour different sites or playlists.   If you have any questions at, please donâ€™t hesitate to <a href="https://t.me/savagezen">send me a message on Telegram</a>, <a href="https://instagram.com/savagezen">Instagram</a>, or on <a href="https://twitter.com/carnivorebjj">Twitter</a>.</p>
