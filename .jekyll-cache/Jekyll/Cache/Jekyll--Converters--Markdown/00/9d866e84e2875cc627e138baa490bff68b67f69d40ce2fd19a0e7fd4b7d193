I"Ï<p>At present, I have many Dungeons and Dragons (5e) quest logs archived on this site.  There are many, many posts, so I havenâ€™t taken the time to convert them to the new (April 2020) site format as this requires updating the font matter, all internal / liquid links within each post, and purging / externalizing all referenced images (those assets have been removed to improve site performance).</p>

<p>I have no plans to change this in the future, but for personal reference the quest logs remain archived in the <a href="https://github.com/savagezen/savagezen.github.io/tree/master/_drafts/archives">/_drafts/archives</a> section of this siteâ€™s source code.  Happy dungeoning, and may the dice be with you!</p>
