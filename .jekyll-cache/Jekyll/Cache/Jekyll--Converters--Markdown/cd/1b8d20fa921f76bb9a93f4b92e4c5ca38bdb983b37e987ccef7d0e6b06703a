I"¾<p><em>Itâ€™s been a busy holiday season on the road or sure and there is a lot to 
talk about.  As such, Iâ€™ve decided to break the past three weeks down into 
two separate posts.  This one will be â€œlighterâ€ and feature all the basic 
climber / dirtbag / wanderlust things; while the â€œdark roastâ€ will get a 
bit gritty and existential.  This way reader of both can enjoy each 
separately, or togetherâ€¦ like coffee, a perfect Shot-in-the-Dark.</em></p>

<p>Perhaps the most outright change of the season is that Iâ€™ve retired my old 
steed (car) and made <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/BOxoW_ljzQI/">the conversion from sedanlife to 
trucklife</a>.  I have to say, itâ€™s 
a pretty awesome new world!</p>

<p>Whilst my 2004 Chevrolet Impala served me very well over the years (9 of 
them and 180,000 miles) it never knew when it was made that it would 
become a tried and true cragwagon.  The upgrades include:</p>

<ul>
  <li>4 wheel drive (<a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/9vx9_RQDgN/">as suggested here</a>)</li>
  <li>Higher ground clearance (literally drug my muffler halfway from Chattanooga to Atlanta once).</li>
  <li>My â€œbedâ€ is now literally a (truck) bed.</li>
  <li>My living space (bed) is spearate not cluttering my work space (cab).</li>
  <li>I like being â€œa truck guy.â€ (i.e. coolness factor)</li>
</ul>

<p>The one down side is that gas mileage is significantly worse, however, 
comparatively my truck does about the same as anything else I looked at on 
the market (e.g. crossovers, Subarus, etcâ€¦).</p>

<h4 id="climbing---year-review">Climbing - Year Review:</h4>

<p>My 2017 climbing year looks like this:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Total Ascents 2016 / 2017:  168 / 218</li>
  <li>2016 / 2017 Boulder Highpoint: V5 / V7</li>
  <li>No. 5.10a Lead on Gear 2016 / 2017: 1 / 3 (one redpointed)</li>
  <li>No. Pitches Lead on Gear 2016 / 2017: 13 / 25</li>
</ul>

<p>Needless to say then, I had a stellar fall season.  What I think is most 
remarkable is the feeling of breaking into new territory.  The total 
review doesnâ€™t tell the whole story.  I had a good winter climbing on 
gear, followed by a very stagnat feeling summer, then a bomber fall.</p>

<p>The real magic for me was in overcombing the mental plateau of the summer.<br />
I remember thinking I was just â€œstuck.â€  But unsticking myself felt great.<br />
To summarize, I did the following:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Realized that the reason I wasnâ€™t sending harder boulders was because I <em>wasnâ€™t trying harder boulders!</em></li>
  <li>Spent a solid month rehabing my elbows and doing a lot of yoga.  No hangs, minimal climbing, fixing injuries, etcâ€¦</li>
  <li>Spent about two weeks really seriously sitting down and assessing what was holding back in climbing, where I was weak, what I needed to work on, and what I was good at (didnâ€™t need as much work on).  (<a href="http://www.stevemaischtraining.com/know-thyself-a-climbing-self-assessment.html">get suggestions here</a>).</li>
  <li>Spent another couple weeks developing a <strong><a href="http://climbstrong.com/articles/20161229">simple training plan</a></strong> and resolving to actually follow through with it.</li>
  <li>Once the actual climbing began, I honed in my diet (paleo if youâ€™re curious) and tried hardâ€¦ really hard, just a few goes, a few times per week.</li>
</ul>

<h4 id="climbing---goals">Climbing - Goals:</h4>

<p><img style="height: auto; width: 30%; float: right" src="http://www.rockandice.com/Article-Images/News-Photos/July-2014/DeanPotter2.jpg" /></p>

<p>Par for the course with the new year Iâ€™ve started planning some climbing 
goals for myself.  But, I took a different approach this year.  Rather 
than planning one season or even one year at a time I took the long view.<br />
That is, I picked a single route of epic proportion that I imagined to be 
â€œimpossible.â€  Then I asked myself:  â€œWhat do I need to do to get there?â€</p>

<p>This inspiration came from the Anderson brothersâ€™ <em><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Rock-Climbers-Training-Manual/dp/0989515613">Rock Climberâ€™s 
Training 
Manual</a></em>. 
The result was a 5 - 6 year plan all broken all the way down to annual 
benchmarks and seasonal (3 seasons per year) goals.  More specifically 
than that thought, Iâ€™ve taken the priciples that helped me succeed in 2016 
and taken them further.</p>

<p>What am I weak at?  Well, for me, thatâ€™s crimpsâ€¦ the nemesis of my 
sausage-like fingers.  So, I started hanging on full and half crimps and 
specifally seeking out the crimpiest lines in the gym.  Whatâ€™s the next 
degree?  <strong>What am I scared of?</strong>  The answer:  roofs on gear.  That puts 
me in a predicament living in the Southeast I know, but all the more reason 
to head the advice of the great Dean Potter and <a href="http://www.rockandice.com/lates-news/dean-potter-what-ive-learned">go towards your 
fears</a>(safely).</p>

<p>With all this Iâ€™ve literally drawn up several years worth of <a href="www.stevemaischtraining.com/using-a-route-pyramid-for-systematic-progress.html">training 
pyramids</a>.  Some of the top tiers have specific milestone routes.  Some 
lower tiers intentionally specify a â€œmini-projectâ€ that intimidates me.  I 
do believe there is a (relatively) safe approach to all this that begins 
with swallowing oneâ€™s ego and beginning with toproping said intimidating 
line, then aid climbing to get familiar with the placements, repeating 
both of those, going for the lead and accepting that <em>it is a hard line 
and you may fall</em>, and finallyâ€¦ eventually gunning or a redpoint.</p>

<p>For beginning the new year Iâ€™ve got two immediate general (non-climbing 
specific) goals for the next month or so.</p>

<p>1) Build / Assess Base Fitness (e.g. resistance traning and flexibility</p>

<p>2) Refine Diet to Establish â€œIdeal Weightâ€ (for roped season only, gear is heavy enough without excess mass bodyweight)</p>

<p>Looking more long term Iâ€™m planning to employ most of the principles 
talked about in <a href="http://www.powercompanyclimbing.com/blog/2016/12/19/episode-22-integrated-strength-training-with-steve-bechtel">this podcast by Power Company 
Climbing</a>.  So, generally, that looks like this:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Ongoing â€œintegrated strengthâ€ (~2 exercises to focus on per block 
period)</li>
  <li>Alternating blocks of maximum recruitment (e.g. limit bouldering / 
weighted deadhangs) and power / endurance (e.g. linked problems, campusing).</li>
  <li>Using the gym to train a specific energy system of need.  Letting my 
crag time take care of technique (i.e. conserative and focused apporach to 
pyramid goal).</li>
</ul>
