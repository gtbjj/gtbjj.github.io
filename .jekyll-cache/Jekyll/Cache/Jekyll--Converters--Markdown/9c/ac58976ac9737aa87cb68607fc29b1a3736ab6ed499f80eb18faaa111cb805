<p>My favorite backup utility right now has to be 
<a href="https://syncthing.net">Syncthing</a>.  It is simple to implement and use and there 
is no reliance on a third party (e.g. Google Drive, Dropbox, etc‚Ä¶).</p>

<p>We should know by now that one backup is never enough.  Once upon a time I bought 
a 64 GiB thumb drive from Amazon for about $40 and this served as my ‚Äú<em>~daily 
rsync</em>‚Äù backup.  This was all good and well and pretty damn nifty to have a 
perfect, bootable, replica of my home pc attached to my hip all day.</p>

<p>However, when I‚Äôm not playing system admin at home, I‚Äôm usually rock climbing 
somewhere in the <a href="http://www.seclimbers.org/">Atlanta-Birmingham-Chattanooga 
Triangle</a>.  Needless to say I smashed a few of those 
aforementioned thumb drives in the past few years.</p>

<p>Most of us carry dang powerful pocket-god computers around every day, why not 
backup to that!?  Many times I experimented with Google Drive 
(<a href="https://github.com/Grive/grive">grive</a>) and always seemed to come up 
dissatisfied.  I even went so far as to tinker (and have some success) with a SSH</p>
<ul>
  <li>Rsync combo through a home WiFi network.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>But there is a better way my FOSS friends!</strong> Hosting your own local server to 
volley backups to and fro from doesn‚Äôt have to be as complicated as it seems.<br />
Yes, maybe <a href="https://owncloud.org/">ownCloud</a> is a bit more pollished and 
<a href="https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/BitTorrent_Sync">BTsync</a> can do similar 
things.  But, <a href="https://github.com/syncthing/syncthing">Syncthing is open 
sourced</a>(and free) and is essentially 
effortless to set up.</p>

<p>Maybe you want the simple route of syncing  your phone‚Äôs pictures back to your 
desktop:</p>

<p>1) Gather the things:</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><table class="rouge-table"><tbody><tr><td class="rouge-gutter gl"><pre class="lineno">1
2
</pre></td><td class="rouge-code"><pre>* Install the [Syncthing Android  App](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.nutomic.syncthingandroid)
* Install the [official Syncthing Arch  package](https://www.archlinux.org/packages/?name=syncthing)
</pre></td></tr></tbody></table></code></pre></div></div>

<p>2) Prepare your phone:</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><table class="rouge-table"><tbody><tr><td class="rouge-gutter gl"><pre class="lineno">1
2
</pre></td><td class="rouge-code"><pre>* Open the app and add the relevant folder contianing your pictures
* Swipe over to ```DEVICES``` and tap the ```+``` on the top-right corner
</pre></td></tr></tbody></table></code></pre></div></div>

<p>3) Ready your PC:</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><table class="rouge-table"><tbody><tr><td class="rouge-gutter gl"><pre class="lineno">1
2
3
</pre></td><td class="rouge-code"><pre>* On your desktop do ```$ systemctl --user start syncthing```
* Navigate to ```localhost://8384``` in your pc's web browser
* Click ```Actions``` then ```Show ID```
</pre></td></tr></tbody></table></code></pre></div></div>

<p>4) Connect the devices</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><table class="rouge-table"><tbody><tr><td class="rouge-gutter gl"><pre class="lineno">1
2
</pre></td><td class="rouge-code"><pre>* Tap the QR-Code icon on your phone
* Snap a pic of the QR-Code on your desktop screen
</pre></td></tr></tbody></table></code></pre></div></div>

<p>5) You can then go back on your phone and select which folders to share with the 
<em>new device</em>.</p>

<p>Likewise, do some of that in reverse and sync all of <em>~/home</em> to 
<em>/storage/ext_sd</em>.  Though, for a copmete backup I‚Äôd recommend <a href="https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/System_backup_and_reinstall#Configurations">backing up 
your system 
settings</a> 
to somewhere in <em>~/home</em> with a simple <a href="https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Cron">cron 
job</a> as well.</p>

<p>Seemingly contrary to Android 4.4.x KitKat‚Äôs limitations regarding 3rd party apps 
writing to the external SD Card, there is a work around for this.  You can install 
and app like <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=org.openintents.filemanager">OI File 
Manager</a> 
to create a folder in <em>/storage/ext_sd</em>.  Technically the app ‚Äú<em>owns</em>‚Äù the 
folder it creates, and thus non-root apps can write there.  Whatever folder you 
create, maybe <em>/storage/ext_sd/pc-backup</em>, just choos that to sync to 
<em>~/home</em>.</p>

<p>Everyday use is easy too.  I have a shell alias set up to A) connect to WiFi via 
<em>netctl</em>, B) deploys my firewall via <em>iptables</em>, and C) start the 
<em>syncthing</em> server.  All I have to do then is launch the app on my phone while 
the PC / Laptop are connected to the same WiFi network.</p>

<p>The initial sync will, of course, take quite a while and very long if you have a 
lot of data.  However, I‚Äôve found it pretty reliable and snappy after that.  Even 
if you miss a few days, chances are if you launch the app while you‚Äôre grinding 
away at your deask, your files can sync up nicely before bed.</p>

<p>All in all <em>syncthing</em> is simple, savy, easy to use, and just plain gets the 
job done!  Cheers to the devs!</p>
