I"¿	<p>Having been a full fledged dirtbag for a month now I feel qualified to make such a list in the spirit of Jeff Foxworthyâ€™s <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">"You might be a redneck if..."</code> jokes.  All of the below are true events / observations that have occurred in the past month.  If youâ€™d like to add to the list, shoot me an email at <a href="mailto:southeastdirtbag@gmail.com">southeastdirtbag@gmail.com</a> with the subject line â€œYou might be a dirtbagâ€.  So, without further delay, here we go.</p>
