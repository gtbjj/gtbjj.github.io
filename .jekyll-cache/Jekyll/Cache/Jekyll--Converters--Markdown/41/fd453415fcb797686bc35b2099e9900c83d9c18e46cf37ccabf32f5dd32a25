I" <p>There are dozens of nutrition related certifications out there.  How do you chose the one that’s best for you?  While dietitians require a license in the state they practice, the term “nutritionist” isn’t as tightly regulated.  Similarly, counseling requires a license, but “therapist” does not.  Obviously there’s room for some sketchy interpretation of ethics and scope of practice there – don’t get me start on <em>“life coaches”</em>.</p>

<p>However, that’s not what this post is about.  The certification I settled on was <a href="https://www.precisionnutrition.com/">Precision Nutriton</a> and I got a message on Instagram asking what made me choose that particular certification.</p>

<h3 id="reason-1">Reason #1</h3>

<p><strong>They are repeatedly recognized as one of the top certification programs.</strong></p>

<p>Secretary of States (or rather their professional licensing boards) regulate licenses.  There’s no such verification of of “certifications.”  So, how much is a certification worth?  Whatever people agree it’s worth.  If I host <em>Austin’s 2-day Keto Workshop</em>, then print out a certificate at the end and declare every <em>“Keto Coach Certified”</em>, that doesn’t mean a whole lot.</p>

<p>In contrast, when you’ve been recognized by <em>Time Magazine, The New York Times</em>, the <em>San Antonio Spurs</em>, and the <em>Carolina Panthers</em> you’ve gained some clout.  On top of that, if you Google “best nutrition certification”, PN is features in 4 of the first 5 results. Solid.</p>

<h3 id="reason-2">Reason #2</h3>

<p><strong>The price was right.</strong></p>

<p>A vetted certification comes at a price.  Some functional medicine training programs will run you $2,000 - $4,000.  I wasn’t looking to take out another student loan, just vet myself and make sure I know what I think I know and earn the credentials to show it (see above).</p>

<p>At the time I registered, PN was offering a zero-down promotion.  When your first payment isn’t due for 30 days, you’ve got a timetable to finish the course (I actually did it in 3 weeks, early).  Therein you get to <em>“try it before you buy it.”</em>  Even if you don’t finish the course in the first month, you can get pretty deep into it (if you don’t then there’s a big message for you to turn around!).  You’ll be able to tell if the content is too complicated or too simple, if the authors’ MO jives with yours, or if you’re really even serious about certification.</p>

<p>After the first 30 days you make monthly payments rather than a flat fee.  This is convenient for me as well because it gives me a fair and modest earnings quota for my “side hustle.”  The bill keeps me accountable to remain diligent in this process.</p>

<h3 id="reason-3">Reason #3</h3>

<p><strong>Our values aligned.</strong></p>

<p>As I started into the program, I loved that PN approaches health from a multifaceted perspective (there is a video in <a href="https://t.me/kombatkitchen">our Telegram group</a> taking about “the wheel of health / deep health”).  If you have ready any of <a href="https://kombat-kitchen.square.site/">the Kombat Kitchen e-books</a> then you know this is something I’m adamant about as well.  The video referenced above also discusses the differences between my viewpoint / categorization of the facets of “deep health” and PNs.</p>

<p>Simply put, the same 6 components (physical, social, existential, cognitive, environmental, and emotional) are all covered, they’re just categorized differently in Kombat Kitchen (mental, social, physical, nutritional health).</p>

<p><strong>The production value is excellent.</strong></p>
