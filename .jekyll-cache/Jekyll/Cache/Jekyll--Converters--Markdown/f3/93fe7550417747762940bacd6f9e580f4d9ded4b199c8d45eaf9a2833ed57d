<p>The day has come for me to shake ‘the norm’ of post-graduate life.  It is also a time to pursue a dream that many climbers fantasize about but very very few muster the courage to commit to.  I mean that in a matter-of-fact and sympathetic way.  Everyone has their reasons, obviously ‘the system’ is supposed to be enticing and comfortable and easy to get sucked into and even easier to stay sucked in.  Honestly, I don’t blame anyone for more or less selling (or trading) their dreams for a family and a desk.  It’s just not the life I want, not now anyway.</p>
