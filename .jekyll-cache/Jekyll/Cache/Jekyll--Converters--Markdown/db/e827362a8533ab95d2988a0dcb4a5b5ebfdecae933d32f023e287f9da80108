I"x<p>I got to looking into managing memory and power settings 
lately which led me to a slew of <em>vm</em> settings.  This is 
configured through a system daemon 
(<em>/etc/sysctl.d/daemon_name.conf</em>).  In this case Iâ€™m 
working with virtual memory, so with good sense I dubbed 
the file <em>vm.conf</em>.  The descriptions below are from 
examples in the Arch Wiki.</p>
