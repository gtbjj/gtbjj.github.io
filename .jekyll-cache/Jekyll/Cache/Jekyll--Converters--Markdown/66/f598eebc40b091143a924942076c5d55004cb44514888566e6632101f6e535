I"<p>Alright folks, her are my reflection points for week 4 of the <a href="/tags/carnivore75hard">#carnivore75hard</a> challenge.</p>

<p><strong>5/11:</strong>  I slept straight through the night again!  Again, for about 6 hours <em>and</em> woke up before my alarm, though I decided to take a <em>“nap”</em> for the extra hour.</p>

<p><strong>5/12:</strong>  It’s my birthday!  Once again, I nearly slept through the night (about 6 1/2 hours), peed and took another <em>“nap”</em>.</p>

<p><strong>5/13:</strong>  I read a <a href="https://carnivoreaurelius.com/carnivore-diet-diarrhea/">recent article on Carnivore Aurelius about diarrhea</a> and can confirm at least one cause.  We all know that (even without fiber) diarrhea tends to be a problem when first starting a carnivore diet.  However, I have found that for me, when I consume added processed fats, the diarrhea returns – and stops when I remove them.  I know that tallow was a main offender and that I did not have the issue with butter.  I don’t know about ghee, since I haven’t used it in a while and when I did it was in conjunction with tallow.</p>

<p><strong>5/14:</strong>  I had to wake up especially early this morning and had a longer than usual day ahead of me (due to lockdowns I’m having to pick up some odds and ends work shifts where/whenever I can get them).  I broke my caffeine trend pretty severely (about 700 mg), but was able to get back on track the next day.</p>

<p>As an aside, I did feel pretty <em>“perky”</em> after the first 300mg dose especially having been on a “<em>decaf only”</em> protocol for about a week (40 - 60 mg / day).  This is something I had speculated about in <a href="/posts/carnivore-90-day-review-01/">my last study</a> regarding changes in dosing and building a tolerance.</p>
