<p>That is a quote from the latest issue of Rock and Ice featuring a memorial cover story on Dean Potter.  tangentially Iâ€™ve developed a bit of a postmortem man-crush on Dean Potter.  I heard the news and posts on social media of Deanâ€™s death, actually I first heard of it from a dear BJJ friend who advised me to <code class="highlighter-rouge">"Be careful out there Dalton"</code> (yes, itâ€™s a <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0098206/">Road House</a> reference).  For whatever reason I had put off watching <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt3784160/?ref_=fn_al_tt_1">Valley Updrising</a> â€” which I absolutely loved â€” until then and saw it as a worthy time, not knowing how the film ended (in reference to Dean).</p>

<p>Now, Iâ€™m not into slack lining, donâ€™t have pans for taking up BASE jumping, and my friends â€” and mother â€” who are reading this donâ€™t have to worry about me free soloing any time soon (although I must admit <a href="http://www.mountainproject.com/v/half-ass-roof/110882718">solo highballs have kind of captured me</a>).  Of course I never knew Dean Potter, but the more I read, the more I feel connected in a pseudo-spiritual sense of admiration for Deanâ€™s sense of prowess and passion for the world and what  heâ€™s doing in it.  Heâ€™s seems to have very much been the <code class="highlighter-rouge">I'm gonna do what I want in order to be as free as I possibly can, and **** you if you get in the way</code> kind of guy; though not out of spite, out of deep desire and commitment to his mission.</p>

<p>A couple days ago I was offered (and accepted) a full time job not too far from where Iâ€™ve been camping.  This puts me in quite an interesting position.  When i began this journey I had crossed the line and dove into the dark side.  i mentally prepared myself for something much more treacherous than three weeks (more to the tune of three or six months, or even a year if I needed to).  I had to go there,<code class="highlighter-rouge">suffering the depths of possibility</code> was the only way to build enough <code class="highlighter-rouge">courage to keep going</code>`.</p>

<p>Iâ€™ve also committed to this lifestyle and, for now, it is enough.  It has brought on a whole new realm of consciousness in terms of what is <code class="highlighter-rouge">"needed"</code> and totally re-aligns what you <code class="highlighter-rouge">"want"</code> from yourself, your world, your life, and your friends.  I literally threw away (not counting what I sold on eBay or gave to GoodWill) at least half of everything I own.  Not to mention, dropped a small fortune at REI upgrading my camping gear for this semi-permanent endeavor.</p>

<p>Really though, actually having a full time job many not need to stop this journey.  After all, if you picked up anything from my manifesto then you should know that this totally <code class="highlighter-rouge">is not about money</code>.  Scheduling will have a lot to do with how long I can continue on this path.  How long I <code class="highlighter-rouge">want to</code> continue is dependent on how long it remains worth it.  There are, of course a lot of peculiarities about my predicament regarding psychotherapy and that professional field, but <a href="https://gymjones.com/knowledge/19-why">other more profound writers and elite athletes expressed similar prose</a>.</p>
