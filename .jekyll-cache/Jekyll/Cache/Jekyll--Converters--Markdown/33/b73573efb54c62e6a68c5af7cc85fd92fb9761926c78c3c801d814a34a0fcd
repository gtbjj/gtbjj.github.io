<p><em>Summary:</em></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>From a self satisfaction standpoint that looks like a pretty good ratio.  There are some things you hate and that stress you out that you‚Äôre still going to have to do.  Fortunately, that was what I spent the least time doing.  In contrast, I spent, by far, the majority of my time doing things that I love and find fulfilling (#winningatlife).  Then, in the middle, things I do to a minimum standard (without passion) and that I‚Äôm capable of but give me some anxiety were about even.  The punch line is this <code>the time spent on "unique abilities" was more (barely) than the other three categories combined.</code>  That seems to be the catalyst  for a thriving life.  But, what about a thriving business‚Ä¶.. (below)</p>

<p>High-Leverage Activities I Didn‚Äôt Work On:</p>

<ul>
  <li>N/A</li>
</ul>

<p><em>Summary:</em></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>More good news here!  <code>I spent more time on high-leverage activities than low leverage activities.</code>  Obviously some low-leverage things like house cleaning and hygiene will always be necessary; as will the things like meditating and playing because if you don‚Äôt have a thriving life (part 1), then you won‚Äôt have the energy to produce a thriving business.  Things like reading and journaling got included in the high-leverage group because most of my reading and journaling is based around business development as of late.</p>
