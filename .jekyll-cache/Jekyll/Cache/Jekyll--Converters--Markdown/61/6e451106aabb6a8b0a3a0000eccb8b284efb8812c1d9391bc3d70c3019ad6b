<h4 id="gofundme-and-page-views">GoFundMe and Page Views:</h4>

<p>In the last 30 days, the <a href="/climbing">climbing section of this blog</a> has gotten more views than any other page.  The <a href="/tags/#suburban dirtbag">Suburban Dirtbag 
posts</a> account for nearly 30% of my pageviews.  Apparently people are interested in reading 
about my (sometimes mis)adventures!</p>

<p>When youâ€™re homeless a few extra dollars can go along way.  So, Iâ€™ve set up a <a href="https://www.gofundme.com/2od7vl0?ssid=834811418&amp;pos=1">Go Fund 
Me campaign</a>.  The figure of $600 comes from a rough correlation to one monthâ€™s rent.<br />
The premise for me was this:  what is the content here and on <a href="https://instagram.com/savagezen">my Instagram</a> worth to you?  Iâ€™m not being 
greedy, Iâ€™m thrilled just to get pageviews, shares, and reshares.  So maybe thatâ€™s what the content I produce is worth to you.  Maybe itâ€™s 
worth a cup of coffee, or a beer, or a gallon of gas (that will surely fuel the next adventure).</p>

<p><strong>Where else does my money go?</strong>  As described on my Go Fund Me page, most of the funds raised will be used directly by me (food, fuel, 
etcâ€¦).  Some (10%) will be used to contribute to organizations I believe in.  In this case, <a href="https://www.accessfund.org/">The Access Fund</a> 
and <a href="http://www.seclimbers.org/">The Southeastern Climbers Coalition</a>.  You could donate to these organizations directly, but by doing so 
through me youâ€™re also endorsing the way I take up involvement in them. .</p>

<h4 id="cold-frost-and-condensation">Cold, Frost, and Condensation:</h4>

<p>Weâ€™re well into the only couple months that we really have to worry about the â€œcoldâ€ here in the south.  Fortunately, my day job runs me in and 
out of buidlings, offices, schools, and (heated) homes.  So the days arenâ€™t much trouble.  The nights, however, are something different.</p>

<p>Here in the south we have a uniquely humid cold that downright damp and misserable (e.g. count on lots of rain at about 25 - 45 degrees). 
 Earlier this week I awoke to ice inside my trunk where I was sleeping!  Big mistake, I forgot to leave a window cracked to let the moisture 
from my breath escape.  Iâ€™d known about this principle with tent ventilation, but it had slipped my mind in the car.  Lesson learned.</p>

<p>Another good lesson, and ode to Wal-Mart, is sleeping bags.  While I love my ultralight Marmot sleeping bag (good for 45â€™), night temperatures 
are well below that now, even with an added liner (+5-8â€™).  I didnâ€™t need another backpacking sleeping bag, I 
needed something to leave in my car.  For that, $15 got me another 50â€™ bag from Wal-Mart.  Layering the two together should be good down into 
single digit temperatures especially depending on what layers youâ€™re wearing to bed.</p>

<h4 id="projecting">Projecting:</h4>

<p>Last week I talked about the great bouldering season Iâ€™ve been having.  This morning I found myself very frustrated on a (for me) very hard 
climb.  I gave in to all kinds of negative self-talk and much colorful swearing.  After 10 really-try-hard attempts within a couple hours I 
decided it wasnâ€™t going to happen today.</p>

<p>I had to remind my self that <strong>success isnâ€™t dependent on sending</strong>.  You donâ€™t (and wonâ€™t) make it to the top every time; at least not if 
youâ€™re truly challenging yourself (especially in the areas you have deficits).   â€œProjectingâ€ requires an investment of time, phsycial and 
emotional effort.  If it came easy or quick, it wasnâ€™t a project.  The term gets overused a lot to describe a problem or route someone has 
tried (maybe) a handful of times and would like to add to their ticklist.</p>

<p>When I think of the â€œprojectsâ€ that I really had to project over the years, I literally cannot tell you how many attempts each one took before 
I finally completed the climb.  The best guess is that it was â€œso many that I literally stopped countingâ€; likely more than 50.</p>

<p>Success can come in small doses and that was the case for me today.  I had a fast start to the early season and felt a bit down as my 
progression stabilized.  However, I recalled a similar process to today on another recent test-piece boulder problem.  I got all excited 
having chunked a â€œnext levelâ€ problem down to a couple sections thinking â€œItâ€™ll for sure go in the next session or two.â€  Well, three or four 
sessions later I find myself getting a little better and refined every attempt, but still not standing atop the boulder.</p>

<p>All I can do is get a little better every day.  Someday the problem will go down.  Someday it may even go easy.  Then, itâ€™s on to the next one 
that is the new â€œnot easy.â€ Itâ€™s just another climb that has something to teach me.  So I guess Iâ€™ll keep cherishing the process of 
failing.  Climb on!</p>
