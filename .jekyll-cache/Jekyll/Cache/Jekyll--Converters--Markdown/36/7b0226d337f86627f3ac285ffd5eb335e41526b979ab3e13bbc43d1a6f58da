<p><strong>dnd-tools</strong></p>

<p><a href="https://github.com/savagezen/dnd-tools/pull/4">Pull Request 4</a> was made earlier this week which offered several improvements including backwards compatibility with Python 2.  Previously Python 3.6+ was required due to the use of <code class="highlighter-rouge">secrets()</code>.  <a href="https://github.com/savagezen/dnd-tools/pull/3">Pull Request 3</a> implemented secrets, but the discussion in Pull Request 4 shows the conclusion that only the random tools embeded in <code class="highlighter-rouge">secrets()</code> were being used, rather than all of its functionality.</p>

<p>The merger of Pull Request 4 also bring the following fixes from <a href="https://github.com/Kronuz">@Kronuz</a>:</p>
<ul>
  <li>PEP 8</li>
  <li>Added missing variable</li>
  <li>Correct misspellings</li>
  <li>Using random with system‚Äôs PRNG if possible</li>
  <li>Package configuration setup in <code class="highlighter-rouge">setup.py</code></li>
</ul>

<p>I made another push today that includes NPC classes in the character creation function.  Essentially this allows you to select from 35 NPC classes when building a charcter / NPC.  Creating an NPC is otherwise identical to creating a player character.  This is because ‚Äústock values‚Äù for standard NPCs are avaialble in many online bestiaries and in the Monster Manual.</p>

<p>Specific features <em>may</em> be added in the future, but it would take a large time commitment, though not too much difficulty to add the default stat blocks for each NPC class.</p>

<p><strong>rakudo-star / star-meta</strong></p>

<p>There have been many, many, many, many issues with getting Rakudo Star to build properly.  This has been most frustrating as both <a href="https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/rakudo/">rakudo</a> and <a href="https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/rakudo-git/">rakudo-git</a> have been building and installing fine.</p>

<p><a href="https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/rakudo-star/">Discussions on the Rakudo Star AUR page</a> and <a href="https://github.com/savagezen/pkgbuild/issues/2">discussed issues on GitHub</a> have both lead to the suggestion of a meta-package.  Recent points made in the AUR discussion indicate that this is also the suggestion from upstream (since they seem to be neglecting the issue).</p>

<p>At any rate, fortunately a <a href="https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/zef/">zef package</a> already exists in the AUR so making a meta package only required a post install script that used Zef to install the modules included in Rakudo Star (<a href="https://github.com/rakudo/star/blob/master/modules/MODULES.txt">listed here</a>).</p>

<p>So, today marks the release of <a href="https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/star-meta/">star-meta</a>, a meta package that pulls down the additional Perl6 modules found in Rakudo Star.</p>

<p>The <a href="https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/rakudo-star/">rakudo-star</a> package will continue to exist in the AUR and on <a href="https://github.com/savagezen/pkgbuild/tree/master/rakudo-star">my GitHub page</a> for the time being, though they may be removed in the future.</p>
