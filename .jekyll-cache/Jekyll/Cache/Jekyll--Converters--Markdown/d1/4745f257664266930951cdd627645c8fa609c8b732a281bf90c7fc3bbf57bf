I"<p>There are dozens of nutrition related certifications out there.  How do you chose the one thatâ€™s best for you?  While dietitians require a license in the state they practice, the term â€œnutritionistâ€ isnâ€™t as tightly regulated.  Similarly, counseling requires a license, but â€œtherapistâ€ does not.  Obviously thereâ€™s room for some sketchy interpretation of ethics and scope of practice there â€“ donâ€™t get me start on <em>â€œlife coachesâ€</em>.</p>

<p>However, thatâ€™s not what this post is about.  The certification I settled on was <a href="https://www.precisionnutrition.com/">Precision Nutriton</a> and I got a message on Instagram asking what made me choose that particular certification.</p>

<h3 id="reason-1">Reason #1</h3>

<p><strong>They are repeatedly recognized as one of the top certification programs.</strong></p>

<p>Secretary of States (or rather their professional licensing boards) regulate licenses.  Thereâ€™s no such verification of of â€œcertifications.â€  So, how much is a certification worth?  Whatever people agree itâ€™s worth.  If I host <em>Austinâ€™s 2-day Keto Workshop</em>, then print out a certificate at the end and declare every <em>â€œKeto Coach Certifiedâ€</em>, that doesnâ€™t mean a whole lot.</p>

<p>In contrast, when youâ€™ve been recognized by <em>Time Magazine, The New York Times</em>, the <em>San Antonio Spurs</em>, and the <em>Carolina Panthers</em> youâ€™ve gained some clout.  On top of that, if you Google â€œbest nutrition certificationâ€, PN is features in 4 of the first 5 results. Solid.</p>

<h3 id="reason-2">Reason #2</h3>

<p><strong>The price was right.</strong></p>

<p>A vetted certification comes at a price.  Some functional medicine training programs will run you $2,000 - $4,000.  I wasnâ€™t looking to take out another student loan, just vet myself and make sure I know what I think I know and earn the credentials to show it (see above).</p>

<p>At the time I registered, PN was offering a zero-down promotion.  When your first payment isnâ€™t due for 30 days, youâ€™ve got a timetable to finish the course (I actually did it in 3 weeks, early).  Therein you get to <em>â€œtry it before you buy it.â€</em>  Even if you donâ€™t finish the course in the first month, you can get pretty deep into it (if you donâ€™t then thereâ€™s a big message for you to turn around!).  Youâ€™ll be able to tell if the content is too complicated or too simple, if the authorsâ€™ MO jives with yours, or if youâ€™re really even serious about certification.</p>

<p>After the first 30 days you make monthly payments rather than a flat fee.  This is convenient for me as well because it gives me a fair and modest earnings quota for my â€œside hustle.â€  The bill keeps me accountable to remain diligent in this process.</p>

<h3 id="reason-3">Reason #3</h3>

<p><strong>Our values aligned.</strong></p>

<p>As I started into the program, I loved that PN approaches health from a multifaceted perspective (there is a video in <a href="https://t.me/kombatkitchen">our Telegram group</a> taking about â€œthe wheel of health / deep healthâ€).  If you have ready any of <a href="https://kombat-kitchen.square.site/">the Kombat Kitchen e-books</a> then you know this is something Iâ€™m adamant about as well.  The video referenced above also discusses the differences between my viewpoint / categorization of the facets of â€œdeep healthâ€ and PNs.</p>

<p>Simply put, the same 6 components (physical, social, existential, cognitive, environmental, and emotional) are all covered, theyâ€™re just categorized differently in Kombat Kitchen (mental, social, physical, nutritional health).</p>

<p>I also like their categorization of clients (level 1, 2, and 3).  Again, Kombat Kitchen is broken down into â€œbeltâ€ levels as well.  Similar to PNâ€™s â€œlevel 1â€, Kombat Kitchenâ€™s â€œwhite beltâ€ (and â€œblue beltâ€) is a fundamentals-first type of program that is written for the very beginning of beginners, yet could still yield great benefits for recreational athletes as well.  Obviously you wouldnâ€™t approach all clients the same, hence the distinction in PN levels and the multiple Kombat Kitchen books of varying complexity and detail.</p>

<h3 id="reason-4">Reason #4</h3>

<p><strong>They include guidance about the business side of thing.</strong></p>

<p>In my opinion, learning the science of nutrition is the easy part.  Thereâ€™s a multitude of good (and crappy) resources online ranging from blogs to podcasts to YouTube channels, etc.  Whatâ€™s much harder for a lot of people is that coaching isnâ€™t just dispensing facts, itâ€™s changing behavior (interpreted loosely regarding the above categories).</p>

<p>I have been practicing counseling for over 5 years and have worked in health care for almost 10.  <em>Iâ€™m not everyoneâ€™s â€œcup of teaâ€</em>, but Iâ€™d say I have a pretty good understanding of how imperative the relational process of human services is.  So, what I really needed help with was the business component (again, they donâ€™t teach you this when youâ€™re in graduate school for counseling / psychology either).</p>

<p>While the business side of things is only one chapter in the certification course, there is an entirely separate book included â€“ <a href="https://amzn.to/33QD8dg">John Berardiâ€™s Change Maker</a>.  Which is explicitly about the entrepreneurship process and path to success.</p>
