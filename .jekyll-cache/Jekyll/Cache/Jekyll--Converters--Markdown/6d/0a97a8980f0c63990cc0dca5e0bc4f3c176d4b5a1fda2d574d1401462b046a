I"•<p>Climbing has been my primary hobby for about four years now.  I like to 
think of myself as a veyr souldful person and as such very much adhere to 
the â€œsoul sportâ€ philosophy of climbing.</p>

<p>Surprisingly, I still havenâ€™t read <a href="https://www.amazon.com/High-Infatuation-Climbers-Guide-Gravity/dp/1594850658">Steph Davisâ€™s â€˜High 
Infatuationâ€™</a>, though itâ€™s a odd paradox that I feel like Iâ€™ve 
already embodied much of the prose of that book â€“ having embarked, for better and worse, on <a href="http://rockandcode.ga/tags/#dirtbag">two dirtbag adventures of my 
own</a>.  I love coming across <a href="http://www.erickraus.com/what-climbing-rainier-taught-me-about-setting-goals/">blog posts like this 
one</a> and being reminded of the many lessons in <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Rock-Warriors-Way-Training-Climbers/dp/0974011215/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1501686870&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=rock+warrior+way">Arno Ilgnerâ€™s 
â€˜The Rock Warriorâ€™s 
Wayâ€™</a>.</p>

<p>Somewhat unusually in this day and age Iâ€™ve been climbing outdoors just about as long as Iâ€™ve been climbing in a gym.  Early on, with a 
belligerent zeal, I embraced outdoor climbing as â€œreal climbing.â€  To date Iâ€™ve ticked over 500 ascents outdoors and things are a little 
differnet.  As it turns out, time has given me a very low tolerance for climbers who condescend on or turn their nose up at climbers who have a 
different preferred style (be it indoor vs. outdoor, boulder vs. trad, etcâ€¦).</p>

<p>As an estblished â€œdirtbagâ€, a few months ago I settled in to a new hous thatâ€™s less than 10 minutes from a climbing gym.  It simply made more 
logical sense to got to the gym as much as possible to make use of this opportunity rather than stubbornly continue to stick out 2+ hour 
commutes to the crag every weekend.</p>

<p>However, this summer has taught me many lessons.  For one, Iâ€™m greatful to be at the crag, when I am there, again.  It is no longer, <em>â€œjust 
another weekend adventureâ€</em>, but recurring special treat â€“ a privilege.  The acceptance of that privelege has shown itself in increased 
â€œstokeâ€ as well as much needed healthy separation from ego and expectations.</p>

<p>On one hand there are the <em>â€œbig milestonesâ€</em> like a new personal record, redpoint, etcâ€¦  Then there are the <em>â€œsmall milestonesâ€</em> that often 
get overlooked such as the spectacular views atop long pitches, or the above picture.  Somewhere in that 28 hours, I still slept 8 hours, went 
to a birthday party, and communited an unneeded 2+ hours.</p>

<p>So, there is no reason to think that it couldnâ€™t have been condensed <em>in-a-day</em>, or even 12-16 hours.  The point is that on that particular 
endeavor my stoke far outlasted my skin, bone, and muscle; proving to me once again how powerfully important it is to keep â€œsoulâ€ in all the 
â€œsportsâ€ that you do.</p>
