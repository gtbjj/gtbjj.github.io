I"Ü<p>A quick memo here on how to persistently set <em>swappiness</em>, or pressure for 
the system to use swap space (<a href="https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Swap_file#Swap_file">swap 
file</a> or <a href="https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/swap#Swap_partition">swap 
partition</a>) 
instead of RAM.</p>

<p>My hardware status has made quite a shift in the past year.  Once upon a 
time I had beefy enough hardware and a minimal enough system that I was 
actually searching for ways to <strong>use more RAM</strong>.  In such a case I would 
want a <em>swappiness</em> value of <em>0</em> (which is the minimum).</p>

<p>Fast forward to now, where I have very modest netbook and I need to make 
the most of swap space as to keep RAM available for what really needs 
it. For this, I want a higher <em>swappiness</em> (100 is the maximum value).</p>

<p>The default vaule is <em>60</em>, which you can check with:</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>$ cat /proc/sys/vm/swappiness
-----
60
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Changing the value of that file wonâ€™t do any good since it is populated at 
boot.  So, to set things persistently we need to make a system call.</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code># nano /etc/sysctl.d/99-sysctl.conf
-----
# set swappiness (0 - 100)
# low	= LESS swap use
# high	= MORE swap use

vm.sappiness=100	# default 60
</code></pre></div></div>

<p><strong>To summarize</strong>, you want a low <em>swappiness</em> level if you have a ton of 
RAM to use and want maximum performance.  Conversely, if you need to use 
RAM sparingly, you want a high level of <em>swappiness</em>.</p>
