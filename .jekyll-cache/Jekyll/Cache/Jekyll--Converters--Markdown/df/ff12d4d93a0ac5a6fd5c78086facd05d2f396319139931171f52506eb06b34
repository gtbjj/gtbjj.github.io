<p><em>Summary:</em></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>From a self satisfaction standpoint that looks like a pretty good ratio.  There are some things you hate and that stress you out that you‚Äôre still going to have to do.  Fortunately, that was what I spent the least time doing.  In contrast, I spent, by far, the majority of my time doing things that I love and find fulfilling (#winningatlife).  Then, in the middle, things I do to a minimum standard (without passion) and that I‚Äôm capable of but give me some anxiety were about even.  The punch line is this <code>the time spent on "unique abilities" was more (barely) than the other three categories combined.</code>  That seems to be the catalyst  for a thriving life.  But, what about a thriving business‚Ä¶.. (below)</p>

<p>High-Leverage Activities I Didn‚Äôt Work On:</p>

<ul>
  <li>N/A</li>
</ul>

<p><em>Summary:</em></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>More good news here!  <code>I spent more time on high-leverage activities than low leverage activities.</code>  Obviously some low-leverage things like house cleaning and hygiene will always be necessary; as will the things like meditating and playing because if you don‚Äôt have a thriving life (part 1), then you won‚Äôt have the energy to produce a thriving business.  Things like reading and journaling got included in the high-leverage group because most of my reading and journaling is based around business development as of late.</p>

<hr />

<p>Block one appointment for yourself / week ‚Äújust to think‚Äù:</p>

<ul>
  <li>I don‚Äôt have a formula for this, but have a very intuitive sense of when I want to ‚Äúdo more‚Äù or ‚Äúgo harder.‚Äù</li>
  <li>I like to listen listen to podcasts.  Sometimes I have headphones in all day, but eventually get to a point where I‚Äôm tired of hearing someone‚Äôs voice.</li>
  <li>For Example:  Sometimes I listen to the radio or podcasts while driving, but  more often than not I listen to nothing at all and just let my thoughts roam.</li>
</ul>

<hr />

<p>This article pairs well with a later activity (<a href="/assets/docs/changemaker-rocks.pdf">Jar of Rocks</a>).  Our resources (time, money, etc‚Ä¶) are limited, like the space in a jar.  We all have different things that go into the  jar, but all those things fall in to one of three categories:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Big Rocks:</strong>  These are the big ticket life items like family, housing, food, clothing, health.  We need to make sure we‚Äôve got room (resources) for all our ‚Äúbig rocks‚Äù first.</li>
  <li><strong>Little Rocks:</strong>  These are technically non-essential, but they give fulfillment, fun, meaning, and purpose to our lives: ‚Äúpassion projects‚Äù, hobbies, excelling at work, competing as an athlete.</li>
  <li><strong>Sand:</strong>  This is the filler, the nice-to-haves.  It can be fun, but it can also take up way too much space.  <code>If we fill our jar with too  much sand first, we don't have room for the big rocks</code>.  Sand is things like watching TV, playing video games, going drinking (alcohol or coffee), social media (scrolling).</li>
</ul>
