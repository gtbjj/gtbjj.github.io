I"{<p>You need to be responsible for know what can kill you when you’re NOT climbing.  For example, while marching into Rocktown the other day I ran into <a href="https://instagram.com/p/5-73McwDtW/?taken-by=southeastdirtbag">this guy</a></p>

<p>I’m not very good at picking out poisonous plant and venomous critters, but I knew enought to keep my distance and let him do his thing.  A ten minute wait for him to cross the trail was well worth not suffering a bite on the mountain top, especially when I was by myself. At any rate, I was prompted to look out for myself a little better and do some research.  Here are a couple quickies worth taking a peek at:</p>
