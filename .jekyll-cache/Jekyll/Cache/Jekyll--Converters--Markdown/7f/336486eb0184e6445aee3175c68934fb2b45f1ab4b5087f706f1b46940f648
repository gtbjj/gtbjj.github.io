I"¬<p>Maybe one of the most difficult things about jiu jitsu is measuring progress.  Iâ€™ve had several notebooks, spreadsheets, and apps over the years.  They all have pros and cons and Iâ€™ll get to those in a bit.</p>

<p>Lately, Iâ€™ve been going hard on the nutrition scene, but want to publicly publish some of my thoughts on jiu jitsu.  This is a new level to my training logs and aforementioned journals.  Theyâ€™ve always been private prior.</p>

<p>Iâ€™ve watched that video from Chewy several times and Iâ€™ve settled on two primary content areas for this category of this site.  1) processing experiences (should anyone care to read them or not, theyâ€™re still a chronological snapshot for me), and 2) a list of goals or things to work on.</p>

<p>As Iâ€™ve mentioned before, Iâ€™ve used apps and posted screenshots to Instagram, etcâ€¦ but the return has been minimal.  Writing in a paper journal takes more effort, but it also has a different impact on your neurocircuitry because of that.  Basically, apps are easy come, easy go.</p>

<p>I love spreadsheets.  However, itâ€™s more of the same.  All the meticulous data crunching in the world doesnâ€™t mean shit if you canâ€™t get out there on the mat in test / change some things.  I know, Iâ€™m a little tongue in cheek here, as typing in a blog post is basically same as typing on a phone / app.  But, the digital process log seems like a good idea.</p>

<p>I do agree, too, with Chewy that keeping a list of techniques trained on a give day isnâ€™t necessarily helpful unless you plan to start the next day by reviewing the previous.  There is so much to learn (and much of it we forget).  Youâ€™ve really got to be disciplined and realize that general group glasses are for the general student.  If thereâ€™s something you like or are struggling with you may need to work with that at a different pace than classâ€™s schedule.</p>
