I"I<p>Since completing the official curriculum for my Precision Nutrition certification I’ve been making my way through the <a href="https://amzn.to/33XNzvz">Change Maker</a> book.  Much to my relief it’s quite an interactive read.  So, as I progress through each chapter / exercise I’ll be sharing the process and outcomes.</p>

<p>For this exercise, I made sure to document my own responses before looking at any of the survey results I sent out to my colleagues.  I conducted the following in double blind fashion.  All peer responses were anonymous (I don’t know who’s answers belong to who) and peers were also prompted individually (no one else knew who else was being asked).</p>

<h3 id="discussion">Discussion</h3>

<p><strong>The first things to pop out</strong> to me is that the responses were very congruent; not just between myself and the respondents, but between the respondents and each other.</p>

<p><strong>What’s more</strong> may be that there aren’t any blind spots.  There isn’t any answer I gave that wasn’t mentioned by at least one of my peers for every question.  In other words, I haven’t invented some kind of false narrative to tell myself.  What I believe I am and how I am as I act are very aligned (you Kant catch me Nietzsche! – <code class="highlighter-rouge">#philosophyjoke</code>).</p>

<p><strong>It warms my heart</strong> to see these responses, not only because they’re congruent with my own (e.g. I’m not imagining or lying to myself about my relationship to my work or my colleagues), but because I think my colleagues did a much better job describing me than I did.  The punch line being that the person they are describing is exactly the person I want to be, or at least the person I want to present to the world.  That is, someone who is:</p>

<ul>
  <li>resilient and tenacious, yet caring</li>
  <li>has a desire to learn and grow through experience</li>
  <li>practical, balanced, unafraid to ask / say difficult things</li>
  <li>focused and analytic, but passionate</li>
  <li>loyal to people I care about, and still have a sense of humor</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Immediately after reading this</strong> I thought <em>“damn, I should probably print this out and attach it to every future resume!”</em></p>
