I"<p>There are dozens of nutrition related certifications out there.  How do you chose the one that’s best for you?  While dietitians require a license in the state they practice, the term “nutritionist” isn’t as tightly regulated.  Similarly, counseling requires a license, but “therapist” does not.  Obviously there’s room for some sketchy interpretation of ethics and scope of practice there – don’t get me start on <em>“life coaches”</em>.</p>

<p>However, that’s not what this post is about.  The certification I settled on was <a href="https://www.precisionnutrition.com/">Precision Nutriton</a> and I got a message on Instagram asking what made me choose that particular certification.</p>

<h3 id="reason-1">Reason #1</h3>

<p><strong>They are repeatedly recognized as one of the top certification programs.</strong></p>

<p>Secretarys of State (or rather their professional licensing boards) regulate licenses.  There’s no such verification of of “certifications.”  So, how much is a certification worth?  Whatever people agree it’s worth.  If I host <em>Austin’s 2-day Keto Workshop</em>, then print out a certificate at the end and declare every <em>“Keto Coach Certified”</em>, that doesn’t mean a whole lot.</p>

<p>In contrast,</p>
