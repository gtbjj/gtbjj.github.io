I"X<p>It is one of those days when you hate the world.  I want to destroy something beautiful.  The day started grand:  a routine work meeting in the mid-day then I was off to the crag.  After some trying and heady moderates i was satisfied with the afternoon.  I still needed to save some daylight to hike out and set up camp.  As I approached the parking lot I thought my car looked a bit lopsided.  As I got closer I knew what had happened.  I spoke aloud with irony and sarcasm:  <code class="highlighter-rouge">Well, i didn't park in a hole so this can only mean one thing.</code> (flat tire).</p>
