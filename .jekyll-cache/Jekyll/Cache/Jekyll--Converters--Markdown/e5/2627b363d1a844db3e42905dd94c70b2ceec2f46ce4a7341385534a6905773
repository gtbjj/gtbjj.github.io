I"ö<p>This post is long overdue, but Iâ€™ve long been plotting a comparison of Interactive Governor profiles for the Nexus 6P.
If youâ€™re unfamiliar with the process:  the Interactive Governor is very customizable and can be optimized for a variety
of work loads.  These settings can be saved as â€œprofiesâ€ to be loaded when needed.  Of course, work loads and background
tasks vary user-to-user, so there are already many published settings out there.  I set out to see how well they work for
me.</p>
