I"£<p>My 90 day carnivoreversary is on 5/14, but I wanted to pre-publish some literature reviews on specific test I was looking at over the past 30 days.  Part 1 (here), <a href="/posts/carnivore-90-day-review-02/">Part 2</a>, and <a href="/posts/carnivore-90-day-review-03/">Part 3</a> will be a review of relevant literature on caffeine and performance as well as cold showers and recovery (and a few other things).</p>
