I"ƒ<p>Sixty something days into my carnivore journey I came across a new challenge â€“ enter <a href="https://nutritionwithjudy.com/carnivore75hard/">#carnivore75hard</a>.  I like a good challenge, be that fitness or nutrition.  30 days â€œsprintsâ€ can be a good way to reset, re-calibrate, and get back on track if youâ€™ve fallen of the wagon or just want to re-up your motivation.</p>
