I"Å<p>Week 1 I relied heavily on staying at a friendâ€™s house (4 / 8 nights) and 3 nights were spent in Walmart parking lots.  Last night was beautiful, 68 and breezy though a bit humid still.  No doubt, this will be a lonely journey.  I put over 3,000 miles on my car in July (actually closer to 3,500) between work and crag trips.  Iâ€™d say that i was on the road more than I was home, but then, reallyâ€¦ I am the highwayâ€¦ a modern day drifter.</p>
