## Savagezen

<p style="text-align: right">
  <strong>(noun)</strong> | <i>A state of being</i>
</p>

> The transient state oscillating between serenity and chaos amid fulfillment of both creative and destructive energies ultimately coalescing in the pursuit and challenging of human nature.  Embrace that violence is always an option and savor life's tranquil moments.  Be relentless in the pursuit of what sets your soul on fire.  <i>Amor fati.</i>

### Introduction

This site has gone through many incarnations.  It began as a homemade wiki of tutorials, problems, and solutions I'd worked on with Arch Linux.  From there it journaled my rock climbing dirtbag adventures.

At some point quest logs from tabletop role playing games were added as well as development notes from my Android projects.  Eventually, I included more nutritional research I had done as well as some reflections on starting and competing in combat sports again.

  <summary>My Road to Carnivory</summary>
  Many moons ago, circa 2008, I began scouring bodybuilding forums to supplement my wrestling training.  In 2010 I found my self carrying over 200 lbs on my 5'8" frame.  I started training boxing, BJJ, and MMA then, and in 2011 took a more serious look at my diet.
  <br /> <br />
  I started to ditch the "bro-science" and be more methodical, picking up a copy of Tim Ferriss's *The Four Hour Body*.  It wasn't too long then until I transitioned to Robb Wolf's *Paleo Solution* and Mark Sisson's *Primal Blueprint.*  And so I set out on my paleo path happily from 2012 - 2019.
  <br /> <br />
  There was some experimenting along the way, including a vegetarian and even raw vegetarian stint, as well as some hang ups and regressions -- life is tough and rife with unexpected challenges.
  <br /> <br />
  I stopped training combat sports in 2013 and at the end of 2018 I decided I wanted to return.  My first endeavor was to "get back to my fighting weight" (e.g. about 160-165 lbs.).  I went back to a strict paleo food list, but added ketogenic macronutrients (70% fat, 20% protein, and 10% carbs) as a last bet to "see if I was ready to back."  Well I did.
  <br /> <br />
  That went well for all of 2019, except I found myself in a flurry of ups and downs, sometimes creeping back up to 170 lbs.  I always seemed to be working in more and more bars and shakes; and I never could completely divorce junk food.  I often debated a negotiated different cheat meal schedules.
  <br /> <br />
  Eventually I felt I'd gone too far in that direction (fat bombs, gross amounts of liquid calories, junk cravings, etc...) and by nature of the paleo / primal / keto circles I travel in, stumbled upon the carnivore diet.  Sketpical as anyone at first -- we *need* vegetables right! right? -- and an adamant self-tester, I decided I could try anything for 30-days, measure the outcomes, and analyze my next step.
  <br /> <br />
  Excluding not only fruits, but vegetables, was madness right?  There's no way this is a "healthy" diet.  We're supposed to "eat the rainbow", right?  I figured I was healthy enough to try anything for 30 days, and honestly expected some grotesque nutritional deficits.  What did the first 30 days reveal?  Did I get scurvy, no.  Did I have massive nutrient deficiencies, not really (especially when you consider the bioavailability of the nutrients I was consuming).  The biggest benefit for the first 30 days for me was that <strong>I completely killed any and all desire for junk food</strong>.  I'm not exaggerating.  This had never happened for me before, not on paleo, not on keto, never.  I just lost the desire for it, much less continue be controlled by the cravings and live simply to white-knuckle it from one cheat meal to the next.
  <br /> <br />
  So, I did another 30 days.  What happened this time?  I got leaner than I've ever been on my life.  Somehow I seemed to add a little muscle mass as well.  This is <i>virtually impossible to do at the same time</i>!  Alright, so what about another 30 days?
  <br /> <br />
  In the third 30 days I started sleeping better and my mood improved.  I don't have a way to quantify this, but I can tell you that it was noticeable by my friends and colleagues.  Co-workers literally asked what was going so well in my life because they could notice a palpable change in my body language and mood.
  <br /> <br />
  The rest, as they say, is history.  After the first 90 days I settled down with the experimenting and got less meticulous with the tracking and focused on educating others as well as furthering my own education.  As long as I continue to feel good, perform well, and continue to find RCTs and meta-analysis to support my practices this is the route I'll stay on.
