### Introduction

This site has gone through many incarnations.  It began as a homemade wiki of tutorials, problems, and solutions I'd worked on with Arch Linux.  From there it journaled my rock climbing dirtbag adventures.

At some point quest logs from tabletop role playing games were added as well as development notes from my Android projects.  Eventually, I included more nutritional research I had done as well as some reflections on starting combat sports again.

  <summary>Read my road to carnivory!</summary>
  Many moons ago, circa 2008, I began scouring bodybuilding forums to supplement my wrestling training.  In 2010 I found my self carrying over 200 lbs on my 5'8" frame.  I started training boxing, BJJ, and MMA then, and in 2011 took a more serious look at my diet.
  <br /> <br />
  I started to ditch the "bro-science" and be more methodical, picking up a copy of Tim Ferriss's *The Four Hour Body*.  It wasn't too long then until I transitioned to Robb Wolf's *Paleo Solution* and Mark Sisson's *Primal Blueprint.*  And so I set out on my paleo path happily from 2012 - 2019.
  <br /> <br />
  There was some experimenting along the way, including a vegetarian and even raw vegetarian stint, as well as some hang ups and regressions -- life is tough and rife with unexpected challenges.
  <br /> <br />
  I stopped training combat sports in 2013 and at the end of 2018 I decided I wanted to return.  My first endeavor was to "get back to my fighting weight" (e.g. about 160-165 lbs.).  I went back to a strict paleo food list, but added ketogenic macronutrients (70% fat, 20% protein, and 10% carbs) as a last bet to "see if I was ready to back."  Well I did.
  <br /> <br />
  That went well for all of 2019, except I found myself in a flurry of ups and downs, sometimes creeping back up to 170 lbs.  I always seemed to be working in more and more bars and shakes; and I never could completely divorce junk food.  I often debated a negotiated different cheat meal schedules.
  <br /> <br />
  Eventually I felt I'd gone too far in that direction (fat bombs, gross amounts of liquid calories, junk cravings, etc...) and by nature of the paleo / primal / keto circles I travel in, stumbled upon the carnivore diet.  Sketpical as anyone at first -- we *need* vegetables right! right? -- and an adamant self-tester, I decided I could try anything for 30-days, measure the outcomes, and analyze my next step.
  <br /> <br />
  And so it began.
