-5/5 first time i've ever slept 8 hours straight, and woken up before my alarm!
  * minimizing total caffeine and absolutely none after nooon
  * regular bed / wake time +/- 30 min
  * bed time routine (airplane mode, yoga (no time), read (no time))

-5/6 ketones driving much higher w/ similar fasting (16 - 20)
  * cutting out sugar free gum
  * hard to tell exactly due to wide interval range on strip bottle (0, 5, 15, 40...) so I've had to estimate the values in my logs.
