hardest part is consistently fasting
- it feels good and is easy... until it isn't, or your schedule falls out of whack

return of diarrhea with super high levels of (added) fat
- pushing for the the *paleo medicina* recommendation of 2:1 fat:protein by weight which is about 4:1 by calorie
- typically still around 3:1, but hard without adding tallow / ghee to coffee or to cook meats in
- difficult to find suet in stock
- pork back fat is in most grocery stores, but high in omega 6
- more "neutral" ratio is 2:1 (by calorie), with most muscle meats being around 1:1, but I've been trying to manipulate my ketone levels for experimentation

struggles with omega-3
- salmon is expensive
- virtually all canned fish is going to have heavy metals
- fish higher in o3, but not high enough in fat overall (see above)
