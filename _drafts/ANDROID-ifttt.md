#### App Reveiew:  IFTTT

One of my favorite app discoveries recently has been **If This Then That**.  I think I had a brief stint with the app before, but some of it's more "basic" features have really stuck out to me this go round.

Partially that is due to some other app failures, or less than stellar satisfaction.  I really only use the app for two specific sets of fucntions, but they are simple and work flawlessly and do just what I need.  Allow me to explain.

**GitHub:**  There are several GitHub clients floating around the Play Store and I've tried several, if not all, of them.  While they all host a slew of features the area that I found they all fall short in was notifications.  T

hey woudl work great for a while, and then all of the sudden they would stop.  Check the app and sure enough, my GitHub page is registering notifications, they're just not getting passed to my phone by the app.  Bummer.  

This is particularly important to me because I'm an IT hobbyist, not a professional.  That means I don't live on GitHub and sometimes just need basic information and notifications filtered from the cruft.

***Solution:*** IFTTT can input a slew of GitHub notifications (pull requests, opened issues, closed issues, new repos by specified users, etc...).  This works out great for me to, in turn, get a text (sms) message when someone files and issue or makes a pull request to one of my GitHub repos.  Perfect!  *This solution is good for other upstream updates as well, such as Android security patches, letting me know to sync and rebuild my local AOSP and kernel branches.*

**News and RSS:**  Speaking of clearning the important informatoin from the cruft.  Anyone who'se used Google's Google app probably knows that there can be a pretty vast divide between the news you want to read, and the news Google *things you want to read.*

Later I got into experimentation with RSS feeds, widgets, and the sort.  This was nice to have the "new I really care about" on my homescreen, but admitedly got pretty dull pretty fast.  Yet, these are typical things (like upstream pushes, or blogs / podcasts I listen to religiously) that might not get updated too often, yet I want them to take priority in news app.

***Solution:***  Also like above, IFTTT can input any RSS feed and send you a text message when there's and update.  Again... perfect!

[The IFTTT website](https://ifttt.com/) is easy to sign up for either from desktop or mobile.  The app is intuative and easy to use.  The above ***solutions*** took me less than 10 minutes to configure for several repos and RSS feeds.

The website states that over 1 Billion applets have already been created.  So you can likely run a quick search and find what you're looking for.  Or, as I said above, creating your own is very straight forward.

I'm sure I could drum up some more detailed applet descriptions, but for right now the two featured are a real sweet spot for me and worth sharing in their own right.  Enjoy!
