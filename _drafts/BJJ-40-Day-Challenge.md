#### Log / Results

- Day 1 - 7:  Training as usuall, since start of 2019 typically only had 1 day off per week
- Day 10:  train smart, vary volume / intensity, trust your body, just keep going
- Day 17:  hungry ALL the time -- it's annoying
- Day 19:  sleep quality and quantity are imperative
- Day 21:  nagging wear (sore shoulder, swolen fingers (grips), cauliflower ear), need more sleep; very light drill / movement
- Day 27:  awesome day with lots of guest drop ins for open mat -- first day ladies out numbered men, good variety white/blue/purple; headgear isn't so bad (old school asics = more low profile than comfy cliff keen)
- Day 30:  what day is it?  What are we doing tonight Brain?  The same thing we do every night Pinky, training to win the worlds!; averaging ~8 hours of SLEEP TIME (not just "in bed"), doesn't feel like enough (training ~8-9 hours / week)
- Day 41 (sat, 3/31): elbows a little achy, body feels worn down, not injured, but not at 100% for each session
- Day 49 (mon, 4/8):  creaky swolen fingers overnight, very sore and stiff muscles after nap after morning training
- Day 56 (mon, 4/15): overall energy feels low, missing a little sleep make a BIG difference, muscles sore, elbows stiff
- Day 61 (sat, 4/20): DAMN, my fingers and elbows hurt!  But, damn I went at it hard agianst upper belts
- Day 62 (sun, 4/21): light drilling and rolling, overall sore and stiff everywhere
- Day 68 (sat, 4/27):  feels like brain has stopped "thinking" and body is just "reacting", very fast and fluid transitions (limited by technical knowledge)


#### Sustainable 7-Day Training Schedule

*key is varying intensity and volume.  a 40-day stint is a microcosm of the rest of your life.  some days you go hard, some you go long, and about as many as you do both, you do neither.  In traditional [high/low routine](http://www.powercompanyclimbing.com/blog/2013/09/the-highlow-approach.html), you'd aim to balance high-intensity / low volume days with low-intensity / high volume days.  So let's see how my training schedule "balanced."

|           | Description               | Volume (1-3)   | Intensity (1-3) |
|:---------:|:-------------------------:|:--------------:|:---------------:|
| Monday    | Movement drills at home   | 1 (30 min)     | 1 (low)         |
| Tuesday   | BJJ Class + Rolling       | 2 (1 hour)     | 2 (average)     |
| Wednesday | BJJ Class + Rolling       | 2 (1 hour)     | 2 (average)     |
| Thursday  | BJJ Class + Rolling       | 2 (1 hour)     | 2 (average)     |
| Friday    | Drilling with partner     | 2 (1 hour)     | 1 (low)         |
| Saturday  | Double Class + Rolling    | 3 (2 hours)    | 2 (average)     |
| Sunday    | Open Mat (mostly rolling) | 3 (2 hours)    | 3 (high)        |
|           | **Total:**                | 15 (9.5 hours) | 13              |
|           | **Average:**              | ~2             | ~2              |

So, you can see that the average volume matches the average intensity, which means that I appropriately scaled "hard" days with "easy" ones.  Also, note that Monday and Friday were "active recovery" in terms of intensity, but they still had a purposeful focus (I wasn't "just exercising" or going for a walk, I was training sport-specific movements and techniques), but at a low intensity.
