**General Positional Hierarchy**

- *rear mounted* / back taken on your opponent (best)
- *mounted* on your opponent
- *knee mount* (knee-on-belly) on your opponent
- *side control* on your opponent
- *turtle* (top)
- oppenent in your *guard* (neutral)
- in opponent's *guard* (neutral)
- *turtle* (bottom)
- *side control* by opponent
- *knee mount* by opponent
- *mounted* by opponent
- *rear mounted* by opponent (worst)

The *guard / in guard* positions could be expanded a bit to list different guards (half, closed, butterfly, spider, etc...) all within a "neutral" category.  However, the difference may be in your skill level with each position as noted below.


**Personal Positional Hierarchy (skill-based)**

- BEST:  rear mount on opponent
- GOOD:  mount on opponent
- GOOD:  knee on belly (top)
- GOOD:  side control on opponent
- GOOD:  turtle (top)
- GOOD:  Half Guard (top)
- GOOD:  Half Guard (bottom)
- NEUTRAL: Closed Guard (top)
- NEUTRAL: Closed Guard (bottom)
- BAD:  turtle (bottom)
- BAD:    side control by opponent
- BAD:    knee on belly by opponent
- BAD:    mounted by opponent
- WORST:  rear mounted by opponent

Some Differences based on my skill / style:

- THE GOODs:  most of the "good" positions are in the same order.  I feel comfortable in all of them.
- GUARDS:  I'm very comfortable in half guard, either top or bottom.  I have short legs and struggle sometimes with retaining and attacking from a closed guard.  Passing the closed guard is also much more difficult for me that half guard.  This is also true for me of open guards (spider / DLR).  Half guard is my happy place.
- THE BADs:  this is a bit more complicated.  while having my back taken is obviously a very, very bad position, having my back threatened is something that i feel like I defend very well.  I also feel like I fend off being mounted pretty well.  However, I struggle with recomposing my guard and / or escaping from side control
