*Preface:*  The humble beginnings of this site were to create a Wiki-type reference for myself to remember what I've learned in the worlds of Android and Linux programming.  Then I documented a few of my climbing journies and soon began documenting RPG quests for my / my party's reference.  Many of the things mentioned above still move faster than I have time to write about.  This is particularly true with dog training (see below).  So, I'm going to try and take a time each week to reflect on what I've learned, rather than wait for / write "the perfect post" for any of the given topics that might come up.

#####  1) Dog Training, I'm Still Learning Fast / A Lot

For quite a while, I've had a "things I've learned" draft saved that recalls my dog training / ownership successes and blunders over the past year or so.  This is the most pointed example for this post.  My dog training world is slowing down, but is still moving too fast for me to write out and carefully document eveything thing that happens.

[My Instagram](https://instagram.com/savagezen) doesn't have a huge following, but it documents many successes and has garnered a handful of comments from nationally known trainers and even a few solicitations from "fans" in real life.

#### 2) The Seasonal Nature of Goals

In December I didn't want to wait until the New Year to get started setting goals.  So, I cracked down on my diet again, lauched a few investigative nutritional studies, started doing grapling drills with anybody who was willing, and stopped making excuses not to climb (be that in the gym or at the crag).

Finally!  It has stopped raining here in the Southeast cold, crisp, sunny weather is upon us!  The time is ripe for high friction and hard sending.  However, this comes as I was just getting stoked to get back into Jiu Jitsu after a 5 year layoff.  Slowly I rationalized to myself, that I can keep doing drills with friends or by myself and that is certainly better than sitting on the couch watching IBJJF highlight reels.

It took a minute, but I realized that I'm not avoiding or making excuses to avoid my goal of re-entereing BJJ.  I'm making a practicl choice to prioritize my goals.  January - March is prime crag time in Southeast USA.  The story will not nearly be the same in July - September.  There will be plenty of time to focus on "dog stuff" and BJJ later, but only a short window of the year to really push my climbing hard.
