#### Due Date:  February 2020

Since starting keto, cholesterol has gone up, which is to be expected.  My HDL is awesome, unfortunately, my LDL has gone up by a larger amount which has resulted in my overall cholesterol being high as well.

|                   | Lipid Profile (2/26/19) | Recommended Lipid Profile ([1](https://drjockers.com/high-cholesterol-ketogenic-diet/),[2](https://ketodietapp.com/Blog/lchf/high-cholesterol-on-a-keto-diet-should-you-be-concerned)) |
| ----------------- | ----------------------- | ----------------------------- |
| Total Cholesterol | 257                     | 180 - 300 (but, ratios are more important) |
| HDL               | **89**                  | > 40 men, > 50 women |
| LDL               | 150                     | < 130 |
| Tirglyceride      | **92**                  | < 150 |
| LDL:HDL           | **1.69**                | 3:1 or less (ideal 2:1) |
| Triglyceride:HDL  | **1.03**                | 2:1 or less (ideal 1:1) |

Info on sub-types of LDL / Non-HDL cholesterol and recommendation to remove bulletproof coffe:
  - https://www.healthline.com/nutrition/low-carb-diets-and-cholesterol#section3
  - article makes a the "too much of a good thing" argument, which I can fall in to as much as anyone... "if it's paleo / keto approved, I can eat as much as I want of it!"; but this is the lack of common sense I've often complained about ... I digress
  - coconut oil actually doesn't have any cholesterol, but butter has about 31 mg / TB
  - still need to get those calories in (~200 / day for me)

25% total cholesterol comes from diet (75% is genetic)([reference](https://perfectketo.com/truth-about-keto-cholesterol/))

"For predicting your risk of heart disease, many doctors now believe that determining your non-HDL cholesterol level may be more useful than calculating your cholesterol ratio. And either option appears to be a better risk predictor than your total cholesterol level or even your low-density lipoprotein (LDL, or "bad") cholesterol level." ([source](https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/high-blood-cholesterol/expert-answers/cholesterol-ratio/faq-20058006))

The person reading my results asserted the importance of total cholesterol / HDL (2.9 for me)
 * there is [some evidence for this](https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamainternalmedicine/fullarticle/752318) -- 2001
 * lets get [something more current than 17 years ago](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2747394/) -- 2009
   *both TC/HDL and LDL/HDL are accurate indicators of heart disease
   *TC/HDL is suspected to me more accurate *if* triglycerides are higher than 300 mg (more than tripple my value)
   *"On the other hand, no conclusive data were obtained in relation to the superiority of the total/HDL cholesterol ratio over the LDL/HDL ratio, or vice versa"
   *mentioned several times that TC/HDL and LDL/HDL ratios are much more concerning *if* triglycerides are also high (< 150, [source](https://www.webmd.com/cholesterol-management/guide/understanding-numbers#1))
*include picture of previous "daily diet" w/ butter
*removing some (butter) cholesterol may be a "happy medium"
