Temperment evaluation from [Controlled Aggression](https://www.amazon.com/Controlled-Aggression-Girard-Bradshaw/dp/B005D2SAQ6/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1548425622&sr=8-1&keywords=controlled+aggression) by [Jerry Bradshaw](https://www.instagram.com/tarheelk9/).

*Goals* for police / protection (sport) training, but may be applicable to general trainability as well (for pet dogs)

General:
- 10 months - 2.5 years for Green Dog selection (no resale value after 3)
- better sociability = better nerves (generally)
- weaker nerves = less influence of drive on temperment

---

**Public Sociability (not personal / pack sociability):**

- social dogs = confident and forced greeting (though, sometimes to submit to dominant dog)
- neutral dogs = "no fear is registered, and the dog simply ignores the stranger (to avoid conflict)", can be handler dependent or defensive
- unsocial dog = refuses to approach or allow anyone to approach

*Goal:  Social or (confident) Neutral*

---

**Nerves (Adaptability to Change):**

- Fluid (adaptability) = no hesitation and immediate acceptance of change
- Studied (adaptability) = initial concern, but able to investigate and confident enough to negotiate w/o lingering
- Cautious (adaptability) = dog adapts, but takes "shepherding" through changes by trainer
- Incomplete (adaptability) = dog is funcitonal in new environment, but never to same degree as familiar landscape
- Halted (adaptability) = dog is minimally funcitonal in new environment and never improves from this level
- Accelerated (adaptability) = dog who cannot function at all in new environment and shuts down despite trainer's efforts

*Goal:  Fluid or Studied adaptability*

---

**Drives:**

- Prey (hunting and retrieving)
  - 
- Social (pack)
  - very imporant for (competitive) obedience; "willingness to please", tactile / verbal reward
- Defense (of prey, territory, self)
  - dogs with low defense threshold = poor candidate for compulsive training methods
