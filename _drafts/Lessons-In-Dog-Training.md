Gather as much information and resources as you can.  You can't overprepare.

Things I didn't prepare for:
- how to get the dog home

Adoption Story
- Wanted: active breed to train as a hobby, bond with, needs structure, routine and training to help me decompress, possibly protection sport, make me be selfish (time aware / reason to leave work)
- First dog as adult > segway to other relationships
- browsing shelters for months
- stood up by private sellers (Craigslist)
- foster incidents / competition
- shopping a shelter is like shopping a thrift store:  ask a million questions, but be ready to buy NOW

Things I Got Right:
- Week 1 (or more):  The only things you need to learn are:
  - I'm the boss
  - what "no" means
  - where we go potty
  - then:  all good things come through me, we are a team, here is how to get rewards, manners & behavior
- Basic Obedience:
  - making use of biology
  - we go to the bathroom 4x / day > we eat before we go to the bathroom to "get things moving" > 
- Principles trump prescriptions
- Detective work (blinds and down jackets)
- Adoption / Rescue much more rewarding (to me, I don't know about my animal) than buying from a breeder, though I effective paid the same or more due to vet bills.    I think the monetary aspect (I knew Dean was HW+ when I adopted him) was a good (unconscious) motivator early in training (e.g. I just made a 10-13 year investment, let's not f* it up early on).  However, I don't think the converse is true (below).  Ego and expectations are totally internally driven.  My dog didn't ask my to adopt him and drop a whole paycheck at the vet... that was my choice and any consequential frustration or expectation is my own fault.

Things I Messed Up and Now Have to Fix:
- Physicality:  I did a great job in the beginning of tempering my emotionality when training my dog and maintaining a very stoic attitude throughout every training session.  Admitedly there have been times where I've lost my temper and been unecessarily rough (maybe even hurtful) to my dog when something doesn't go how I'm expecting.  That is, my ego clouds my vision from seeing that my dog is tired or doesn't understand what I'm asking.
- Socialization:  There is one other person and one other dog in my home.  I did a pretty good job of exposing Dean to many different places and things, however I wish that I had thought things out a bit more (with regard to protection work).  I don't think I did anything detrimental to my dog, but I wish I had read "[Who Pets Your Puppy or Dog](http://leerburg.com/whopetspuppy.htm)" much sooner.
- Focus:  Training when dog is not focused on me (e.g. dragging through heeling routine lifeless and half hearted).  Rather, have complete focus for 5 or 10 seconds and expand that than plateau and have to deal with frustration (mine) and disappointment (his).

Things I'm Still Working On:
- Drives and motivation change:  it's my job to make myself interesting to my dog so that he will be engaged with and work for me.  Somedays we like food.  Somedays we like would starve to bite a stick.
- Egos:  Things were easier when we knew nothing about eachother.  Now we have some progress and I have to watch my temper closer than ever because expectations, tension, and disappointment (in myself) travel "right down the leash to the dog" (as they saying goes).
- Having Fun:  Sometimes it's difficult to remember.  The whole point (for me) of training my dog in a working dog fashion is to have a protector and a companion.  The above mentions of *physicality* and *egos* sometimes rob training and palying of their fun which is, in fact, the anteithesis of *good* training and *bonding*.
- Take the long view:  Early progresss skews (or skewed my) perception.  Great things take great effort over a long time.  It's easier for me to see this with things that I've been practicing for a while (like climbing), but am still grasping at with dog training.  As Dan John says, "A little bit, often, for a long time" is give you the best and easiest results.
- **Listen to the damn dog!**:  As summer is setting in, Dean's endurance for any given training session is getting shorter -- he's never been worked in the heat before.  Also, I find myself being more irritable when I and the weather are hot.
