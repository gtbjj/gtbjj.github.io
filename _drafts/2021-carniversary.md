**Happy 1 year carniversary to me!**  He're I'll review some blood work and other helath metrics to see if I'm destroying my body or not.  You can catch the audioversion on [The Kombat Kitchen Podcast](https://anchor.fm/kombatkitchen) or see the video as bonus content in the [Kombat Kitchen Community](https://t.me/kombatkitchen) on Telegram.

A 2018 report [1](https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2018/11/181128115045.htm) indicated that only 12% of the American population is metabloically healthy; that is, 88% meet at least one criteria for metabolic syndrome [2](https://www.nhlbi.nih.gov/health-topics/metabolic-syndrome).

I've written about this before, but just a quick recap, here's what we're looking for:

* Percent Body Fat (rather than the recommended waistline, alone)
* Low Triglycerides (cholesterol)
* High HDL (cholesterol)
* Low Cardiovasuclar Load (rather than the recommended blood pressure alone)
* Low Fasting Blood Sugar (and HgA1c, and low "area under the curve")

### Body Fat

I much prefer this metric over waistline alone, for the same reason(s) that BMI (body mass index) alone is a worthless measure.  It tells us the denisty (mass) of our body, but nothing of what that mass is composed of (e.g. muscle, fat, bone, blood, water?).

Here are my measurements (taken 1/23/21) before my last fight:

With a BMI of 25.4, both the CDC [3](https://www.cdc.gov/healthyweight/assessing/bmi/adult_bmi/index.html) and AHA [4](https://www.heart.org/en/healthy-living/healthy-eating/losing-weight/bmi-in-adults) would classify me as overweight.  As you can see, that's clearly not the case.

Obviously I'm very lean, especially leading up to a fighting sports competition.  Truth be told, that's not what I normally walk around at, so for reference here's the criteria I use (both for my clients and myself).

* Men: Body fat < 15%, < 10% for high performers (this is my "walk around" weight)
* Women: Body fat < 20%, < 15% for high performers

The American Council on Exercise says that essential body fat for men is 2-5% (10-13% for women) and that male athletes should be between 6-13% (14-20% for women)[5](https://www.acefitness.org/education-and-resources/lifestyle/tools-calculators/percent-body-fat-calculator/).  Call me crazy, but given our contry's metabolic **un**health, I think everyone should be "an athlete."  So, adjusting ACE's numbers to something easy to remember brings us to a threshold of 10% for men and 15% for women (who I'd dub "competitive athletes").  On the higher end, I'm willing to accept 15% / 20% (men / women) for "regular athletes" or what I think would be an appropriate benchmark for the general population [6](https://www.winchesterhospital.org/health-library/article?id=41373).

So, putting everything in context, if you adhere to the CDC and AHA guidelines, I'm overweight and underfat.  Wait... what?!  The [BMI chart](https://www.myhmrprogram.com/ContentMedia/Resources/Articles/BMIChart.jpg) that's in every office in every hospital in America is literally telling me to lose muscle and gain fat?!  SMH... moving on....

### Cholesterol

Cholesterol gets a notoriously bad reputation and, likewise, myself and many other have written about it before ([Nadir Ali](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCeHgajYvGU-jHgf1QCa1lbg), [Dave Feldman](https://cholesterolcode.com/), and many, [Kevin Stock](https://www.kevinstock.io/health/carnivore-diet-blood-work/)), and dozens of podcast episodes -- DM me if intersted).  So, what numbers *really* matter.  Desperately tyring to plummit cholesterol is a very bad idea for a number of hormonoal, immune, and cognitive reasons, but that's worth several discussions all on it's own.

The diagnostic criteria for metabolic syndrome are concerned with:

* HDL (recommended above 40 ([7](https://medlineplus.gov/hdlthegoodcholesterol.html))), and
* Triglycerides (recommended below 150 ([8](https://medlineplus.gov/triglycerides.html)))

When we put these numbers together we get a ratio of TG:HDL which, as we're learning, is a much better predictor of cardiovascular disease than TC (total cholesterol) or even TC:HDL ([9](https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamainternalmedicine/fullarticle/752318), [10](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/11732933/)).  AHA recomends this ratio be below 5 (5:1) and that a "healthy" person with a TC of 200 and HDL of 50 has a ratio of 4:1 ([11](https://www.heart.org/HEARTORG/Encyclopedia/Heart-Encyclopedia_UCM_445084_ContentIndex.jsp?title=cholesterol%20ratio)).  A ratio of 3.5:1 is considered very good ([12](https://www.uhhospitals.org/health-information/health-and-wellness-library/article/lab-tests-v1/lipid-panel-with-total-cholesterol-hdl-ratio)), so the lower the ratio, the better.

If you're dead set on using the TC:HDL method ([13](https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/high-blood-cholesterol/expert-answers/cholesterol-ratio/faq-20058006)), we can look at that too.  Recommended at 4:1, with lower being better, we're still heavily dependent on a high HDL to improve this number (or if you prefer, lowering TC; again, bad idea).

[results]

You could say that I'm biased towards my own position, but I feel like the above "recommendations" are geared towards (1) selling medications to (2) a grossly sick population.  What if rather than trying to keep our total cholesterol under 200, the entire US had an HDL over 80 and TGs under 120?!

### Cardiovascuular Load (Heart Rate and Blood Pressure)

I have talked a lot about this in the past as well, partly becasue I did a lot of homework after dozens of doctors told my my blood pressure was high.  It didn't make sense to me that the pressure (or torque if you will) on the heart would be the only thing we look at; especially when my resting heart rate (RPMs in car terms) is *extremely healthy.*

Turns out, there is actually a term for this; *cardiovascular load*.  It is the product of multiplying your MAP (mean arterial pressure) by your pulse to get a single number indicating total stress on the heart (as the name implies).  Common blood pressure guidelines ([14](https://www.health.harvard.edu/heart-health/reading-the-new-blood-pressure-guidelines)) recommend 120 / 80; and the metabolic syndrome criteria is at 135 / 80.  We'll come back to these...

A "normal" heart rate is between 60 - 100, which is an average of 80 beats per minute.  So, let's do some quick math:

| Blood Pressure | MAP | BPM | CVL |
| -------------- | --- | --- | --- |
| 120 / 80       | 93  | 80  | 7440 |
| 120 / 80       | 93  | 75  | 6975 |
| 120 / 80       | 93  | 70  | 6510 |
| 135 / 80       | 98  | 80  | 7840 |
| 135 / 80       | 98  | 75  | 7350 |
| 135 / 80       | 98  | 70  | 6860 |

Now, let's see where I fall in to this:

### Blood Sugar (Insulin Sensitivity)

The CDC gives the following recommendations ([15](https://www.cdc.gov/diabetes/basics/getting-tested.html)), in line with the ADA ([16](https://www.diabetes.org/a1c/diagnosis)):

|             | Fasting Blood Sugar | 2 Hours Later | A1C |
| ----------- | ------------------- | ------------- | --- |
| Normal      | < 100               | < 140         | < 5.7% |
| Prediabetes | 100 - 125           | 140 - 199     | 5.7% |
| Diabetes    | > 125               | > 199         | 6.5% |
