Cheat meals are, of course, not necessary on a keto (or paleo) diet, but the occasional break (mentally and physically) has been beneficial in keeping with keto (for me).

After doing some Google-ing, most articles have only come down saying that paleo is more flexible (due to being ideologically rather than metabolically) driven.

Science hasn't nailed down a nutritional benefit, especially if the two are layered together, so:  Do restrictions of keto give a health or performance benefit over a clean paleo diet?

How "bad" is a cheat meal (again, for me):

| Food           | Carbs | Fiber | Net Carbs |
|----------------|-------|-------|-----------|
| Ice Cream      | 31    | 1     | 30        |
| Dark Chocolate | 46    | 6     | 40        |
| Reese's        | 80    | 4     | 76        |
| **Total**      | **157** | **11** | **146** |

#### Take One:

On a typical day (link) of clean keto eating I average about 40g, net carbs, so:
40 * 7 = 280
280 + 146 = 426


Theory for testing:  "Target Ketogenic Diet (TKD)", in quotes because I'll likely not be in ketosis, but distributing those carbs evenly throughout the week.
426 / 70 = ~60

60g net carbs / day is pretty reasonable actually. and still low compared to the "Standard American Diet."  In my mind, just throwing numbers around, I was thinking 100g per day would be very doable and sustainable.  Most "keto" recommendations are under 50g, though I don't necessarily agree with this depending on the volume of food you eat in a given day (e.g. marcronutrient percentages rather than a fixed number of grams -- I eat about 2800 - 3000 cal / day and my net carb intake is about 8%).

**In Practice:**

- 70 - 100g Net Carbs / Day 
- Food List:  Paleo (with peanuts)

*Results:*

- test period: 15 days
- weight: 76 Kg / 169 lbs (virtually the same)
- ketones: 0 - 5 mg/dl (*** mmol/L) vs 15 mg/dl (0.8 mmol/L)
- performance: no "superman", feel more hungry, but more sustainable (e.g. no cravings whereas SKD resulted in few, but very intense cravings -- had to really pack in calories to avoid a weekly cheat meak; vs. going on two weeks and not really interested in junk food though I did add an occasional piece of fruit throuhgout the day -- still under 100g carbs)
- worokout carb source:  bananas and sweet potatoes (fructose)

#### Take Two:

After some more research I found that fructose (the carb source I'd been using) actually has to be converted to glucose by the liver before being used by your mucles.  So, it's actually the least preferred method.  Some sources recommend a dextrose supplement or white rice / potatoes.  Since I'm currently avoiding supplements and rice is a grain, potatoes it is!

*carb intake can go up if ketones above 0.5 mmol/L (9 mg/dl)


**In Practice:**

- Hard Training (4x / wk): 70 - 100g net carbs
- Regular Activity (3x / wk): < 40g net carbs
- Food List: Paleo (with butter (replaces MCT oil) and peanuts)

- weight:
- ketones:
- performance:
- workout carb source:  white potatoes
