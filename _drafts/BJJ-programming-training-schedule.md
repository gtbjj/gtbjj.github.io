Monthly / Weekly / Daily Goals?

- not everything takes the same amount of time for me to learn
- e.g. maybe just polishing a certain escape / defense position that I got caught in
- e.g. or it might take longer if learning a whole new technique or a position you really struggle with

Technical vs Process Goals?

- technical:  passes from X-Guard, side control escapes, counter to submission X
- process:  breathe through nose, drill for 1/2 open mat time
