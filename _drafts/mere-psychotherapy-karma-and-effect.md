"Alienation gives rise to the pure possibility fo being, a place where one might expect to find a subject, but which nevertheless remains empty.  Alienation engenders, in a sense, a place in which it is clear that there is, as of yet, no subject; a place where something is conspicuously lacking." ~ Fink, The Lacanian Subject

The title chapter of Irvin Yalom's *"Love's Executioner"* paints a picture of sometimes needing to tell harsh truths to our patients.  That is, confront, challenge, or even potentially damage them -- not from a position of malice or negligence, but with the compassionate intent of provoking what ails them in order to expel it (to paraphrase Yalom).  Sometiems the intervention works beautifully.  Sometimes it ends tragically.  Many times the coutomce is something unexpected.

Jessica typifies the 17 year old, blunted, "whatever", punk rock attitude typified in all movies about teen drug use.  At her last group therapy session Jessica insists on giving me a handwritten letter.  What's more is that she wants to read it in front of the rest of the group.  Her persistence catches me off guard, especially when she becomes furious upon learning that a colleague would be facilitating group in my place that day -- as I am filling in some administrative duties.  Fortunately, I am able to make arrangements to attend the last few minutes of group.  In Jessica's own words:

> When I first started (group therapy) I was really scared of everyone and everything, but most of all I was scared of you (Mr. Austin).  I thought you were some grumpy guy who just didn't connect with your patients.  WHen I got moved to your group, I thought "aw fuck..."

> I used to think I wasn't getting better.  I thoguht that no matter what, I was always going to be a little depressed girl with a drug addiction... I didn't want to think I was sick in the head, but I was.  Day after day I was plotting my own death.  You helped me think about what I am going to do with these thoughts.  Am I going to act on them or am I going to let them swallow me whole until I'm dead..."

> Mr. Austin, my favorite memory of you sin't just one random memory.  My favorite memory is us bonding, from the group of the sand, to the group of us being your "therapist."  My favorite memory is you pushing me to get better.  Something I learned from you is that it's okay to make mistakes.  I can make a mistake and still be human.  Thnak you for always listening to me...

> Although I don't believe in god, Mr. Austin, you are a blessing... As for me, I will be in the Army, going to school to become a therapist and help kids just like you do.  I will make you and everyone here proud of me.  Thank you for blessing me and taking care of me."

*I read the letter in full and discuss working with Jessica in [The Kombat Kitchen Podcast: Episode 007: Uncesnoring and Growing as a Therapist](https://anchor.fm/kombatkitchen/episodes/Uncensoring-and-Growing-as-a-Therapist--Episode-007-ep3jdn)*

Jessica's recounting of our work together illustrates many things.  On one hand there is the sheer magnitude of our most stubtle interactions with our patients.  On the other hand, the human service industry as a whole is often, ironically, a thankless job in which sincere expressions of gratitude are exceedingly rare.  They should be celebrated and cherished as such.

On that note, my perception of my owrk with Jessica differs from hers.  From the beginning I like Jessica.  I feel a deep resonance with her personality and am cautiously aware of the transference being evoked.  Perhaps too cautious, a point I'll return to.  About miway through Jessica's treatment I brag to a collaboratingn psychiatrist about Jessica's progress in group.  That night Jessica relapses and is hospitalized for a suicide attempt.  She returns to group several days later.

Before other group members arrive that day I am talking to Jessica individually.  She explains profuse lack of support in her home environement.  In fact, her mother who she lives with, is now refusing to speak to Jessica and her father has employed various shame tactics -- over the phone as he's had little phsyical engagement with Jessica since birth.  Then, perhaps expectedly, Jassica asks me how I felt when I learned that she had relapsed.  I pause for a long second before committing to saying; "I was disappointed."  I don't know if there's a more cruel thing I could have said at that moment.  Jessica's face confirms as he head hangs low with a face emmanating a "screw you too, and thanks fro confirming I'm a failure" expression.

Evidenced by her letter, it seems my words didn't crush Jessica as I feared.  I believe it's too much of a stretch to say that that echange was a catalyst in our work, but it's a poignant memory for me no less.

**Afterward:**

What strikes me most about my work with Jessica is that I didn't feel that I had invested a particuularly large effort into her individually.  Yes, I *liked* her, but there are some clients that we (rightly or wrongly) go above and beyond or out of our way for -- rarely is the sentiment recipripcated.  Yet, sometimes "treatment as usual" turns out to provide something quite exceptional to the patient and we are suprised by joy.  In a similar paradox, I hope that I can change many lives throughout my career, but it is somethign truly awe-striking when two lives (unecpectedly) change eachother.

The truth is always told, if not found -- one way or another, inevitably perceived, consciously or not.  Being kind to people is not the same as being nice.  Being nice would have been patronizing and reassuring Jessica after her replapse (or any other suicide attempt, or the uncertainty of anyone's future for that matter).  I could have lied to Jessica.  Perhaps a single truth did not fundamentally alter the course or outcome of treatment.  Perhaps neither would a single lie.

However, as Jessica identified, it's the thousands of truths (or lies) moment to moment that change lives.  Frequently I tell my patients, "I'll only lie to you when I don't tell the truth; and to save your life."  Usually they laugh awkwardly initially before I can see the wheels startint to turn in their mind.  I don't tell them if that statement itself is a lie or not.  I let them decidemoment to mometn, a thousand truths at a time.

On a final note, I'll disclose that I have one major regret about my work with Jessica.  After she read her letter and was leaving for the day, I remember thinking many times that I wanted to give her a hug.  I am, perhaps too, aware of the staticstics and perceptions of predatory men in (specifically, and unfortuantely) "helping professions"; so I swept away the thought.

When the day is gone, I have a brief fantasy of asying "Come here kiddo, you did good" and hugging her like a father would.  Would enacting that have been for me or for her?  Another paradox, my feeling of regret illustrates a deeper message.  I cannot read Jessica's letter and not think of her words as an embrace; confirming that I too, "did good."
