* Salt requirements, again:
  * Robb Wolf on Cleared Hot (link):  5g sodium in addition to food sources, up to 10g (additional) in 95' heat; high protein does require more water to digest (I made an early note about drinking more water on a carnivore diet).

* For the most part I was spot on in part 1
* Clarification, a "spike" in glucose is expected *any* time you eat (as insulin function is needed, if you produce no insulin, you're Type 1 Diabetic).  It still seems like a "double or triple" spike is dysfunctional, though what is also significantly concerning is how long the spike persisits (e.g. how fast does your glucose return to "normal" / baseline after the spike -- *that* is more akin to *insulin resistance* rather than the baseline level)
* speaking of baseline levels, long term keto can cause metabolic *inflexibility* and "baseline" fasted glucose to creep up (this has been the case for me as well, very gradually).  This suggest a physiological (not necessarily pathological) insulin resistance
* Paul claims no real detriment to honey, and having improved performance in the gym.  He also states that he had more efficient electrolyte use
  * I did a pilot (no data collected) last fall adding carb (fruit) to my ketogenic diet pre-workout.  The dose was around 50g, but that could be manipulated in a future study, and timing was 30-60 min pre-workout, which may be too long.  I didn't find any particular benefit or detriment to the process, but again, I wasn't using any specific metrics. (see future tests)
  * The electrolyte point is interesting as well, especially because I've done a lot of research regarding electrolytes and blood pressure.  It would be interesting if adding honey pre-workout meant I didn't need to supplement with electrolytes and be as aggressive with salt (of course there will still be variability due to exercise intensity and ambient temperature).
