Weight and body composition:  older, cutting before, impairing comp peroformance (link to plaeo / keto post).  Not sure I want to compete again, but it's a good starting place

dreamline link (home practice drills / partner drills / partner mat drills)

- teaching is a neat thing in that you need to just understand how you learned a technique, but understand dozens of different ways to accomodate different body types and histories (cont. below)
- co-worker (white III), similar lay off, 12 years older but 70-80 lbs heavier:  AMAZING how my body remembers to do things once it is moving again; teaching reifies that I absolutely MUST know my shit inside and out.  I didn't ask to be the big fish in a small pond (in fact I'd much prefer to be the smallest, weakest, dumbest, and least technical person in the room), just happen to be the more experienced grappler.
- a complete novice w/ no experience:  On a whim I propositioned my roommate, learning solo drills for myself by having to break down essential grappling movements for him -- let alone actual combat techniques.


existential crisis:
- climibng is "where my soul is" (e.g. the call of the wild)
- bjj is where my heart is, it is what I love everything about
- PS:  Boxing is awesome, and working dogs is comparable to nothing else
- years ago made a post about conflicted feeling of leaving BJJ for climbing (didn't like the local gym scene at the time and had developed a friend circle around climbing after moving to a new state); and a brown belt from my first academy reminded reminded me that "BJJ will always be there waiting for you to return."
- the crags aren't going anywhere... at least for another 10,000 years or so.  I still have all my gear.  I still love the wilderness and challenging myself in it.  I still have climbing goals.  I just need time and favorable weather conditions
- I'm a fighter... built like a fighter, think like a fighter, and always felt like an enigmatic climber; that is, more of surly wolverine than spindly iron spaghetti or titanium feather.
