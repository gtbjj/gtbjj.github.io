Weight and body composition:  older, cutting before, impairing comp peroformance (link to plaeo / keto post).  Not sure I want to compete again, but it's a good starting place

dreamline link (home practice drills / partner drills / partner mat drills)

- teaching is a neat thing in that you need to just understand how you learned a technique, but understand dozens of different ways to accomodate different body types and histories (cont. below)
- co-worker (white III), similar lay off, 12 years older but 70-80 lbs heavier:  AMAZING how my body remembers to do things once it is moving again; teaching reifies that I absolutely MUST know my shit inside and out.  I didn't ask to be the big fish in a small pond (in fact I'd much prefer to be the smallest, weakest, dumbest, and least technical person in the room), just happen to be the more experienced grappler.
- a complete novice w/ no experience:  On a whim I propositioned my roommate, learning solo drills for myself by having to break down essential grappling movements for him -- let alone actual combat techniques.
