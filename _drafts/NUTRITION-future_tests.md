**Queue / Pending Follow Up:**

* 90 day blood panel (~5/14/20)
* [75 Hard challenge](https://nutritionwithjudy.com/carnivore75hard/) (~7/4/20)
* Caffeine and...
    * Triglycerides (pending caffeine / performance results)
    * Blood Pressure / CVL
        * Caffeine and blood pressure:  I thought I had studied this in the past, and had a minimal / no effect, but I can't find the archive
        * caffeine does deplete sodium and magnesium ([r](https://www.instagram.com/p/B_fkn1ogmOz/))
        * 2008, small increase @ 5 cups coffee / day ([r](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19183744))
        * 2010, +6/+3 sys/dia @ 250mg ([r](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2940460/)) 
        * 2017, "coffee restriction not warranted" in otherwise healthy people, 3-4 cups / day ([r](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28128673))
        * 2017, caffeine slows recovery (HRV) and return of BP to baseline (post exercise) ([r](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5658389/))
        * 2019, increased max power, mean power, and grip, but also increased blood pressure ([r](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6566184/))
        * conflicting research about caffeine and kidney stone risk ([r](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4232021/).[r](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17711092))
        * Caffeine can also cause adrenal gland dysfunction, including over production of aldosterone which raised blood pressure ([r](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3619380/), [r](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4866033/), [r](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/10835904)), however there have been some studies **treating this with baking soda**([r](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17886090), [r](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27356528)) -- about 1g sodium and 2g bicarbonate / liter, 1L daily.
* Blood Pressure and Sodium:Potassium Ratio (f/u)
* O3, O6, and Blood Pressure
    * 2015,  O3 = consistent cardiovascular and anti-inflamatory benefits in animals, but mixed results in humans ([https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4537707/](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4537707/))
    * 2020, O3 reduces triglycerides, may reduce cardio mortality, but no effect on all cause mortality; no observed effect on fish consumption  ([https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32114706](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32114706))
     * 6g fish oil / day for 10 weeks reduced blood pressure; O6 from corn oil increased blood pressure ([https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6609124/](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6609124/))
    * O3 raises HDL and lowers Triglycerides; lowers 24-h, day, and night sys/dia by way of anti-inflamatory properties ([https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6085127/](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6085127/))
    *  2019, O3 and O6 can reduce blood pressure ([https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6627798/](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6627798/))
    * bp changes in 3 weeks to 3 months ([https://www.pritikin.com/how-long-lower-blood-pressure](https://www.pritikin.com/how-long-lower-blood-pressure))

**Consideration:**

* Water Filter / Testosterone?
* sleep quality and measures

**Potassium and Sodium Ratio / Blood Pressure (follow up):**

* ratios upwards of 1:1, 2:1, 3.5:1 on paleo ([r](https://paleoleap.com/sodium-potassium-paleo/))
* consider [potassium BHB supplement](https://www.amazon.com/Nutricost-Potassium-Exogenous-Supplement-Beta-Hydroxybutyrate/dp/B06W9KFYFF/ref=sr_1_5?dchild=1&keywords=potassium+bhb&qid=1587208418&sr=8-5) and measure with cognitive performance (test?)
* reintroduce general electrolyte supplement to alter ratio

---

**Caffeine and Triglycerides:**

* The "Ultimate Bloodwork" epidose of the Fundamental Health Podcast ([r](https://castbox.fm/episode/The-ULTIMATE-bloodwork-podcast!-id2108592-id183111720?country=us)) mentions caffeine within 24 hours can raise cortisol (obviously), but triglycerides as well ([r](https://cholesterolcode.com/guest-post-impact-of-coffee-on-triglycerides/)).  As noted elsewhere I drink a fair amount of coffee, but my triglyceride to HDL ratio is 1.47 : 1 which is pretty darn good.
* Pending the results of my test of caffeine as a PED, I may eliminate caffeine entirely.

---

**Super Stupid Simple Cardio:**

* 3 x 10 min walk / day (after meals)([r](https://castbox.fm/episode/How-to-become-as-strong-as-possible-with-Stan-Efferding-id2108592-id207121110?country=us))
* wear a (light) weight vest around the house?  mowing the yard?
* I'm not terribly concerned with my conditioning, given my RHR and VO2 max.  However, I'll follow up after my current tests and potentially establish a "maintenance" cardio routine and skip this study.

**Fat Cycling / Competition Prep:**

* Kevin Stock recommends cutting back fat at least one meal / day (up to all meals / day) for two days, then eating one "regular" day ([r](https://www.kevinstock.io/health/fat-loss-and-the-carnivore-diet/)).

**Sleep Research:** 

Training hard = easy
Recover hard = discipline
The better / faster you recover, the harder / more you can train.  You're not getting the most out of your next workout or training session if you haven't recovered from the last one -- think about digging another hole before the last one's healed.. that's the path to injury!

Best / Cheapest Recovery =? sleep
* we all have to sleep anyway
* obviously we recover when we sleep
* lack of sleep has lots of detriments: increased risk of heart disease, hormone imbalance, mood dysregulation, etc... ([r](https://www.hopkinsmedicine.org/health/wellness-and-prevention/the-effects-of-sleep-deprivation).[r](https://www.healthline.com/health/sleep-deprivation/effects-on-body#1))
* what improves sleep? ([r](http://healthysleep.med.harvard.edu/healthy/getting/overcoming/tips)[r]((https://www.sleepfoundation.org/articles/six-tips-design-ideal-bedroom-sleep)))
    * consistent bed / wake time -- costs nothing
    * avoid screens (meditate / read)  -- costs nothing
    * avoid coffee / nicotine / other drugs (at least 8 hours) before bed -- costs nothing, actually saves money
    * exercise, nap, and eat (your biggest meal) earlier in the day -- costs nothing but planning
    * drink only enough to not be thirsty when waking (try to avoid trips to the bathroom at night)
    * the darker, colder, and quieter the room, the better -- takes some investment
* Consulting with a sleep lab, phone apps are only about 60% accurate, being based on heart rate and movement (e.g. if your heart rate is low and you're not moving the apps think you're asleep even if you're not).
* In my experience a simple 1-5 rating scale seems just as accurate

* Saunas?
   *  probably sweating PLENTY through BJJ

* Massage?
  *  master sleep first, maybe 75 hard v2

* CVS Comprehensive Screening [$60]()
* Home Testosterone Test [$60](https://www.cvs.com/shop/everlywell-testosterone-test-prodid-1860032)
    * Insulin sensitivity correlates positively with testosterone (Fundamental Health - Blue Zones are a myth)
    * if shbg / free is high, may be insulin sensitive
    * free and total
    * if total is low, there's a problem
    * urine tests may have validity issues due to metabolism of testosterone in blood
    * normal range: total 617, free 12.3, shbg 35.5, [r](https://alpha-med.net/blog/f/what-are-normal-testosterone-levels)
* Home Inflamation Test [$100]((https://www.cvs.com/shop/everlywell-vitamin-d-and-inflammation-test-prodid-1860063))
* Home Metabolic Panel [$40](https://www.healthtestingcenters.com/test/basic-metabolic-panel-bmp/)

* Atomic Habits (Know Fear)
    * standaridize before optimize
    * 2 minutes of the thing every day, then build
    * track habits backwards NOT forward (e.g. 1% better than yesterday)
    * "stack" new habit after old habit
    * "you pay for bad habits later, you pay for good habits now" > hockey stick

* Paleo Medicina [fundamental health podcast]
    * 2:1 fat to protein by weight (9:2 by calories, over 4:1)
    * overeating in general can kick you out of ketosis
    * how to get that much fat (w/o added oil / butter)?:  suet, tallow?

* Consider adding fish back for blood pressure (Omegs-3), ([r](https://chriskresser.com/6-ways-to-lower-blood-pressure-by-changing-your-diet/))

* Blood Sugar
  * Caffeine - no effect, [r](https://care.diabetesjournals.org/content/27/12/2990), [r](https://www.dietdoctor.com/does-coffee-raise-blood-sugar-conclusion)
  * Sugar alcohol (gum!) - yes, raises ([r](https://www.healthline.com/health/diabetes/sugar-alcohol-and-diabetes#bottom-line))
  * Fiber = 0 net carbs, sugar = all the carbs, sugar alcohol = 1/2 carb, ([r](https://dtc.ucsf.edu/living-with-diabetes/diet-and-nutrition/understanding-carbohydrates/counting-carbohydrates/learning-to-read-labels/counting-sugar-alcohols/))
  * sugar alcohol can cause diarrhea, is addictive, and different alcohols have different glycemic loads, [r](https://www.healthline.com/nutrition/sugar-alcohols-good-or-bad#section9)
