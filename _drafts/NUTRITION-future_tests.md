title: Future Tests

---

**Queue / Pending Follow Up:**

* 90 day blood panel (~5/14/20)
* [75 Hard challenge](https://nutritionwithjudy.com/carnivore75hard/) (~7/4/20)
* Caffeine and...
    * Triglycerides (pending caffeine / performance results)
        * The "Ultimate Bloodwork" epidose of the Fundamental Health Podcast ([r](https://castbox.fm/episode/The-ULTIMATE-bloodwork-podcast!-id2108592-id183111720?country=us)) mentions caffeine within 24 hours can raise cortisol (obviously), but triglycerides as well ([r](https://cholesterolcode.com/guest-post-impact-of-coffee-on-triglycerides/)).  As noted elsewhere I drink a fair amount of coffee, but my triglyceride to HDL ratio is 1.47 : 1 which is pretty darn good.
* Pending the results of my test of caffeine as a PED, I may eliminate caffeine entirely.
    * Blood Pressure / CVL
        * Caffeine and blood pressure:  I thought I had studied this in the past, and had a minimal / no effect, but I can't find the archive
        * caffeine does deplete sodium and magnesium ([r](https://www.instagram.com/p/B_fkn1ogmOz/))
        * 2008, small increase @ 5 cups coffee / day ([r](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19183744))
        * 2010, +6/+3 sys/dia @ 250mg ([r](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2940460/)) 
        * 2017, "coffee restriction not warranted" in otherwise healthy people, 3-4 cups / day ([r](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28128673))
        * 2017, caffeine slows recovery (HRV) and return of BP to baseline (post exercise) ([r](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5658389/))
        * 2019, increased max power, mean power, and grip, but also increased blood pressure ([r](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6566184/))
        * conflicting research about caffeine and kidney stone risk ([r](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4232021/).[r](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17711092))
        * Caffeine can also cause adrenal gland dysfunction, including over production of aldosterone which raised blood pressure ([r](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3619380/), [r](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4866033/), [r](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/10835904)), however there have been some studies **treating this with baking soda**([r](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17886090), [r](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27356528)) -- about 1g sodium and 2g bicarbonate / liter, 1L daily.
* Blood Pressure and Sodium:Potassium Ratio (f/u)
    * BP and potassium - [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30122481](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30122481)
    * ratios upwards of 1:1, 2:1, 3.5:1 on paleo ([r](https://paleoleap.com/sodium-potassium-paleo/))
    * consider [potassium BHB supplement](https://www.amazon.com/Nutricost-Potassium-Exogenous-Supplement-Beta-Hydroxybutyrate/dp/B06W9KFYFF/ref=sr_1_5?dchild=1&keywords=potassium+bhb&qid=1587208418&sr=8-5) and measure with cognitive performance (test?)
* reintroduce general electrolyte supplement to alter ratio
* O3, O6, and Blood Pressure
    * 2015,  O3 = consistent cardiovascular and anti-inflamatory benefits in animals, but mixed results in humans ([https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4537707/](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4537707/))
    * 2020, O3 reduces triglycerides, may reduce cardio mortality, but no effect on all cause mortality; no observed effect on fish consumption  ([https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32114706](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32114706))
     * 6g fish oil / day for 10 weeks reduced blood pressure; O6 from corn oil increased blood pressure ([https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6609124/](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6609124/))
    * O3 raises HDL and lowers Triglycerides; lowers 24-h, day, and night sys/dia by way of anti-inflamatory properties ([https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6085127/](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6085127/))
    *  2019, O3 and O6 can reduce blood pressure ([https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6627798/](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6627798/))
    * bp changes in 3 weeks to 3 months ([https://www.pritikin.com/how-long-lower-blood-pressure](https://www.pritikin.com/how-long-lower-blood-pressure))

**Consideration:**

* Water Filter / Testosterone?

---

**Super Stupid Simple Cardio:**

* 3 x 10 min walk / day (after meals)([r](https://castbox.fm/episode/How-to-become-as-strong-as-possible-with-Stan-Efferding-id2108592-id207121110?country=us))
* wear a (light) weight vest around the house?  mowing the yard?
* I'm not terribly concerned with my conditioning, given my RHR and VO2 max.  However, I'll follow up after my current tests and potentially establish a "maintenance" cardio routine and skip this study.

---

**Fat Cycling / Competition Prep:**

* Kevin Stock recommends cutting back fat at least one meal / day (up to all meals / day) for two days, then eating one "regular" day ([r](https://www.kevinstock.io/health/fat-loss-and-the-carnivore-diet/)).

**Sleep Research:** 

Training hard = easy
Recover hard = discipline
The better / faster you recover, the harder / more you can train.  You're not getting the most out of your next workout or training session if you haven't recovered from the last one -- think about digging another hole before the last one's healed.. that's the path to injury!

Best / Cheapest Recovery =? sleep
* we all have to sleep anyway
* obviously we recover when we sleep
* lack of sleep has lots of detriments: increased risk of heart disease, hormone imbalance, mood dysregulation, etc... ([r](https://www.hopkinsmedicine.org/health/wellness-and-prevention/the-effects-of-sleep-deprivation).[r](https://www.healthline.com/health/sleep-deprivation/effects-on-body#1))
* what improves sleep? ([r](http://healthysleep.med.harvard.edu/healthy/getting/overcoming/tips)[r]((https://www.sleepfoundation.org/articles/six-tips-design-ideal-bedroom-sleep)))
    * consistent bed / wake time -- costs nothing
    * avoid screens (meditate / read)  -- costs nothing
    * avoid coffee / nicotine / other drugs (at least 8 hours) before bed -- costs nothing, actually saves money
    * exercise, nap, and eat (your biggest meal) earlier in the day -- costs nothing but planning
    * drink only enough to not be thirsty when waking (try to avoid trips to the bathroom at night)
    * the darker, colder, and quieter the room, the better -- takes some investment
* Consulting with a sleep lab, phone apps are only about 60% accurate, being based on heart rate and movement (e.g. if your heart rate is low and you're not moving the apps think you're asleep even if you're not).
* In my experience a simple 1-5 rating scale seems just as accurate

* Saunas?
   *  probably sweating PLENTY through BJJ

* Massage?
  *  master sleep first, maybe 75 hard v2

**Miscellaneous Notes:**

* CVS Cholesterol Screening [$60](https://www.cvs.com/minuteclinic/services/price-lists)
* CVS Comprehensive Screening [$60]()
* Home Testosterone Test [$60](https://www.cvs.com/shop/everlywell-testosterone-test-prodid-1860032)
    * Insulin sensitivity correlates positively with testosterone (Fundamental Health - Blue Zones are a myth)
    * if shbg / free is high, may be insulin sensitive
    * free and total
    * if total is low, there's a problem
    * urine tests may have validity issues due to metabolism of testosterone in blood
    * normal range: total 617, free 12.3, shbg 35.5, [r](https://alpha-med.net/blog/f/what-are-normal-testosterone-levels)
* Home Inflamation Test [$100]((https://www.cvs.com/shop/everlywell-vitamin-d-and-inflammation-test-prodid-1860063))
* Home Metabolic Panel [$40](https://www.healthtestingcenters.com/test/basic-metabolic-panel-bmp/)

* Atomic Habits (Know Fear)
    * standaridize before optimize
    * 2 minutes of the thing every day, then build
    * track habits backwards NOT forward (e.g. 1% better than yesterday)
    * "stack" new habit after old habit
    * "you pay for bad habits later, you pay for good habits now" > hockey stick

  
* Metabolic Health Markers ([https://www.liebertpub.com/doi/10.1089/met.2018.0105](https://www.liebertpub.com/doi/10.1089/met.2018.0105), [r](https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/metabolic-syndrome/))
  * Cholesterol:
      * HDL: > 40 (check)
      * Triglycerides: < 100 (check)
      * no mention of LDL! good, see Dave Feldman's work ([r](https://cholesterolcode.com/about/), [r](https://castbox.fm/episode/Dave-Feldman-and-Siobhan-Huggins-return-for-the-ULTIMATE-lipid-podcast%2C-the-roots-of-insulin-resistance%2C-hs-CRP-and-Lp(a)-id2108592-id179911370?utm_source=website&utm_medium=dlink&utm_campaign=web_share&utm_content=Dave%20Feldman%20and%20Siobhan%20Huggins%20return%20for%20the%20ULTIMATE%20lipid%20podcast%2C%20the%20roots%20of%20insulin%20resistance%2C%20hs-CRP%20and%20Lp(a)-CastBox_FM))
      * trig:HDL ideally 1:1, but commonly "good" at 4:1 (Kevin Shock)([r](https://www.kevinstock.io/health/carnivore-diet-blood-work/))
  * WC: < 102 cm (check)
      * no mention of BMI (thank goodness!) Dr. Tro link
      * BMI, WC, WHR, and WHtR are inaccurate for both lean athletes and fat "normal weight" people ([r](https://jphysiolanthropol.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/1880-6805-33-10))
      * substitute body fat: leanest 5% of Americans would be < 28% (women) and < 17% (men)([r](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3837418/)), or to keep it simple < 30% women and < 20% (men).  For athletes, 20% / 12% is not unreasonable either ([r](https://californianutritiongroup.com/2017/08/01/what-is-your-idea-body-fat-percentage/)).  Essential body fat is about 15% / 5% ([r](https://www.healthline.com/health/types-of-body-fat#essential-fat))
  * Glucose: < 100 / fasted(check)
      * typically < 100 fasted, or 140-180 1-2 hours after a meal ([r](https://images.medicinenet.com/images/illustrations/2019-target-blood-sugar-levels.jpg), [r](https://diabetesalert.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/Blood-Sugar-Levels-Chart.jpg)).  I would suggest the former because if your blood sugar is below 100 (mg/dl) and spikes all the way to 180 post-meal, you're consuming way too much sugar (processed, whole grain, or otherwise) since stabilizing blood sugar is extremely important for managing mood, hunger, and hormones ([r](https://www.diabetes.co.uk/forum/attachments/upload_2018-1-20_8-31-6-png.24983/)).  In fact, a post-meal blood sugar of < 120 (spike of 20-30 mg/dl) would be even better ([r](https://sharimccants.files.wordpress.com/2014/09/blood-sugar-chart.png)).
      * Caffeine - no effect, [r](https://care.diabetesjournals.org/content/27/12/2990), [r](https://www.dietdoctor.com/does-coffee-raise-blood-sugar-conclusion)
      * Sugar alcohol (gum!) - yes, raises ([r](https://www.healthline.com/health/diabetes/sugar-alcohol-and-diabetes#bottom-line))
      * Fiber = 0 net carbs, sugar = all the carbs, sugar alcohol = 1/2 carb, ([r](https://dtc.ucsf.edu/living-with-diabetes/diet-and-nutrition/understanding-carbohydrates/counting-carbohydrates/learning-to-read-labels/counting-sugar-alcohols/))
      * sugar alcohol can cause diarrhea, is addictive, and different alcohols have different glycemic loads, [r](https://www.healthline.com/nutrition/sugar-alcohols-good-or-bad#section9)
      * low body fat?  negative correlations have been found between body fat and insulin resistance ([r](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15824752)), but in an episode of The Healthy Rebellion Radio ([r](https://castbox.fm/episode/Estrogen-and-Soy%2C-Detox-Kits%2C-Ketones-and-Blood-Sugar---THRR016-id2434386-id230589109?country=us)) Robb Wolf talked about a point of diminishing returns when it comes to reducing body fat; e.g. at some point being "too lean" is a stressor on the body
  * HbA1c: < 5.7
    * directly relates to blood sugar ([r](https://professional.diabetes.org/diapro/glucose_calc)), see above
  * BP: < 120 / 80 (140 / 90 in some references dated as recently as 2019)
  * Inflammation, irritation, or swelling
  * increased risk of blood clot, such as DVT (deep vein thrombosis) -- typically influenced by the above factors (smoking, obesity, heart disease, etc.)

* Blood Pressure and Meditation:
    * Metta meditation template - [https://www.nalanda.org.my/6-weeks-of-metta-meditation/](https://www.nalanda.org.my/6-weeks-of-metta-meditation/)
    * transcendental mediation lowers bp by 5 points ([r](http://www.positivehealth.com/article/meditation/transcendental-meditation-health-research-overview))

* Salt requirements, again:
  * Robb Wolf on Cleared Hot:  5g sodium in addition to food sources, up to 10g (additional) in 95' heat; high protein does require more water to digest (I made an early note about drinking more water on a carnivore diet).
