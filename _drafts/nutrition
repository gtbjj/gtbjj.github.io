#### Experiment 012:  Paleo / Keto Performance

- Diet from EXP011 (Paleo @ ~2000 cal, 60% fat, 30% protein, 10% carbs)
- may negatively effect performance:  see headaches on day 14 when exercise intensity increased (blood sugar was normal (94) and urine ketones were almost absent (0.28mmol/L) ([optimal ketone level](https://www.dietdoctor.com/lose-weight-by-achieving-optimal-ketosis), [converting mg/dl to mmol/L](http://www.ucdenver.edu/academics/colleges/medicalschool/centers/BarbaraDavis/Documents/book-understandingdiabetes/ud29.pdf))
- Option A:  Assess for [electrolyte deficit](https://robbwolf.com/2017/02/02/my-training-at-45/) and supplement training days with sports drink (e.g. TKD diet))
- Option B:  Eat more overall, maintain macronutrient ratios
- Intervention (Option B):  1TB grass fed butter in pre and post workout shake (daily ~2200 cal, 65% fat, 25% protein, 10% carbs)
- **Result**:  Day 17 - 40 min BJJ drilling, 20 min BJJ sparring, no issues in training or for the rest of the day.  Day 18 - 20 minutes intense CrossFit style BJJ drills and conditioning, again no issues during training or after.



#### Experiment 013:  Paleo / Keto Nutrient Profile

- Testing sustainability of diet.  Originally not intended for a long trem plan, but a "peak season" temporary measure for athletic performance.  May still be the case due to overall restrictive nature of the above measures.  However, some may question the nutritional soundness of "excessively restrictive" measures.  So let's test that.
- 7 day micronutrient assessment with [Cronometer](https://cronometer.com)
- Average:  2263 cal @ 65% fat, 27% protein, 8% net carbs
- *pictures
- no glaring deficits (minimal database warning for iodine)
  - green 9 / 24 vitamins and minerals
  - yellow 15 / 25 vitamins and minerals
- lowest performers (at or below 50%)
  - Vitamin D, 27% RDA
  - Magnesium, 50% RDA
  - Potassium, 49% RDA
  - Zinc, 37% RDA
