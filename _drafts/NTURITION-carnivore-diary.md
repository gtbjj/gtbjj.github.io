[Paleo Leap](https://paleoleap.com/place-of-dairy-on-paleo-diet/) and some general info:

  * primary concerns are lactose (sugar) and casein (protein) that many people are sensitive to (e.g. allergies and inflammation).
  * all pasteurized milk is "cooked" and has the fat removed and then added back in
  * milk is also mucus (and acidic) so we can expect increased in inflammation
  * humans are one of the only animals that will consume milk from another species
  * humans are *the only* mammals that consume *any* milk after infancy

My experience:

  * typically butter hasn't been a problem
  * I've used whey intermittently, though admittedly it gunks up my stomach in large doses (carnivore retest, 2 scoops)
  * butter and ghee were still okay when I retested them on carnivore
  * cheese in a pinch / hurry, much easier on stomach if dry / organic deli cheese
  * satiety and fat bombs

More recent information:

[Kevin Stock](https://www.kevinstock.io/health/dairy-and-the-carnivore-diet/):

* carnivore-ish / level one approved (does come from animal)
* *meant for* growing baby mammal > loaded with fat, protein, and sugar
* lactase (needed to digest lactose) production stops between ages of 2 and 5
* intolerance is actually "normal"
* casein (from cows, different than in humans) is the most allergenic type of milk protein (versus whey)
* A1 (domesticated cows) vs. A2 (buffalo, sheep, goats); similar raw vs. pasteurized
* Whey = easier to digest than casein, but raises insulin
* Whey signals growth hormones (good?)
* milk peptides have opioid properties
* butter can be good source of cholesterol and saturated fat, and K2 (stops calcium from settling in arteries)
* fermentation tends to improve digestion (think back to cows and 7 stomachs vs a crock pot)
* best options = butter, cream, and whey

Cheese Pros:

 * High in calcium, vitamin D3, vitamin K2
 * good source of conjugated linoleic acid
 * aged cheeses contain only trace amounts of lactose (dry)
 * can be an easy addition to gain weight (lots of calories)
 
Cheese Cons:

 * contains casein which can be addictive
 * high in calories / easy to overconsume
 * fresh cheeses contain more lactose
 * can be inflamatory for some people

 * Dairy: addictive to humans because it's the combination of fat and sugar; great for infants It's why we crave ice cream Rewarding but not satiating Some cut out dairy, and find they're more satiated when eating meat -The carnivore diet and amino intake...1

[Ken Berry on YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZYtaiLznW8):

 * more of the same from Kevin
 * humans = better w/ human milk
 * "obtuse" inflammation (eczema, migrane, IBS, arthritis)
 * worst > lea st bad: skim milk, whole milk (4%), half/half (20%), heavy cream (36% fat okay here up for *most* people), soft cheese (microbe enacted, less inflammatory proteins), hard cheese, butter (still has proteins), ghee (99% fat, no sugar)
