**Curse<a name="curse"></a>:**
You become partially undead and gain resistance to piercing, slashing, and necrotic damage, but have a weakness to fire damage.  Any desires or cravings you experience (love, food, water, greed, adventure, kiling, etc..) can not be satiated.  If you are killed while wearing The Mempo of Twilight, you will be resurrected aboard The Entropy Tide in 24 hours.  If you are resurrected by this ability more than once per year, you become an undead mmeber of the ship's crew, lose your captainhood and control of the crew, and The Mempo of Twilight is respawned in a random location on the world you died in.
