[Magnesium and Hypertension](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15692166)
[Minerals to Control Blood Pressure](https://www.health.harvard.edu/heart-health/key-minerals-to-help-control-blood-pressure)

**Take One:**

|        | Avg. Magnesium Intake | Blood Pressure, RHR |
| ------ | --------------------- | ------------------- |
| Start  | 42%                   | ~ 144 / 88, ~ 77    |
| Week 1 | [383 mg, 96% RDA](https://photos.app.goo.gl/Xn5StjnVBTjqKx1x7) | N/A |
| Week 2 | [251 mg, 63% RDA](https://photos.app.goo.gl/r5yjVnss6hHKJUTP8) | N/A |
| Week 3 | [172 mg, 43% RDA](https://photos.app.goo.gl/gbhBp9VYrUWqFVs79) | 141 / 86, 59 |

Overall workout volume has increased dramatically in the last month or two (since the new year and picking up BJJ again).  Average intensity and volume have increased significantly, regarding effects on RHR

No abservable effect, but after follow up with RN, intake is not high enough from food alone to effect blood pressure.  Needs to be about 400mg agove RDA (e.g. supplement) ([reference](https://www.livescience.com/55355-magnesium-blood-pressure.html)); that's about 800 mg total / day (400 RDA + 400 supplement).  I was averaging (from food intake alone) only 270 mg / day.

**Take Two:**

Magnesium supplements are easy to find ([Amazon Link](), or any pharmacy), but note that Magnesium Citrate has a much better absorbtion rate that Magnesium Oxide.

Dosage:  2 x 250 mg servings / day (this is a little high, but my daily food intake is a little below the RDA (400 mg); so I'd still average about 750 mg / day).  *Start 2/19/19.*

| Date    | Blood Pressure | RHR |
| ------- | -------------- | --- |
| [2/12/19](https://photos.app.goo.gl/5VpNmRpyWyHULXdS6) | 141 / 86       | 59  |
| 2/26/19 | 132 / 78       | 63  |

EXP***:  blood pressure and cholesterol

Since starting keto, cholesterol has gone up, which is to be expected.  My HDL is awesome, unfortunately, my LDL has gone up by a larger amount which has resulted in my overall cholesterol being high as well.

| ----------------- | ----------------------- | ----------------------------- |
| Total Cholesterol | 257                     | 180 - 300 (but, ratios are more important) |
| HDL               | **89**                  | > 40 men, > 50 women |
| LDL               | 150                     | < 130 |
| Tirglyceride      | **92**                  | < 150 |
| LDL:HDL           | **1.69**                | 3:1 or less (ideal 2:1) |
| Triglyceride:HDL  | **1.03**                | 2:1 or less (ideal 1:1) |

Info on sub-types of LDL / Non-HDL cholesterol and recommendation to remove bulletproof coffe:
  - https://www.healthline.com/nutrition/low-carb-diets-and-cholesterol#section3
  - article makes a the "too much of a good thing" argument, which I can fall in to as much as anyone... "if it's paleo / keto approved, I can eat as much as I want of it!"; but this is the lack of common sense I've often complained about ... I digress
  - coconut oil actually doesn't have any cholesterol, but butter has about 31 mg / TB
  - still need to get those calories in (~200 / day for me)

25% total cholesterol comes from diet (75% is genetic)([reference](https://perfectketo.com/truth-about-keto-cholesterol/))

"For predicting your risk of heart disease, many doctors now believe that determining your non-HDL cholesterol level may be more useful than calculating your cholesterol ratio. And either option appears to be a better risk predictor than your total cholesterol level or even your low-density lipoprotein (LDL, or "bad") cholesterol level." ([source](https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/high-blood-cholesterol/expert-answers/cholesterol-ratio/faq-20058006))

The person reading my results asserted the importance of total cholesterol / HDL (2.9 for me)
 * there is [some evidence for this](https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamainternalmedicine/fullarticle/752318) -- 2001
 * lets get [something more current than 17 years ago](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2747394/) -- 2009
   *both TC/HDL and LDL/HDL are accurate indicators of heart disease
   *TC/HDL is suspected to me more accurate *if* triglycerides are higher than 300 mg (more than tripple my value)
   *"On the other hand, no conclusive data were obtained in relation to the superiority of the total/HDL cholesterol ratio over the LDL/HDL ratio, or vice versa"
   *mentioned several times that TC/HDL and LDL/HDL ratios are much more concerning *if* triglycerides are also high (< 150, [source](https://www.webmd.com/cholesterol-management/guide/understanding-numbers#1))
*include picture of previous "daily diet" w/ butter
*removing some (butter) cholesterol may be a "happy medium"

EXP***:  Sleep quality and recovery

Sleep quality may increase stress hormones and thereby increasing blood pressure ([reference 1](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/10075386), [reference 2](https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/high-blood-pressure/expert-answers/sleep-deprivation/faq-20057959))

  - Other References:  [Reference 2](https://www.webmd.com/hypertension-high-blood-pressure/news/20020517/caffeines-effect-on-blood-pressure#1), [Reference 3](https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/high-blood-pressure/expert-answers/blood-pressure/faq-20058543)
  - Folgers Breakfast Blend 40 mg / TB ([source](https://cspinet.org/eating-healthy/ingredients-of-concern/caffeine-chart)), though I usually drink Folgers Black Silk
  - I don't want to cut out coffee completely becasue frankly I enjoy it, and don't like water in my protein shakes
  - I'm hesitant towards decaf coffee (though not opposed to 1/2 caf) because frequently the decaffinating process changes the flaver (and I DO NOT like that)

  - Starting:  2 cups M-F (2 TB each) and 3 on weekend, but more recently 3 / day given 7 a.m. BJJ workouts and sometimes rock climbing in the same day (I've got to be ready when the weather is willing to cooperate).  At 40 mg / TB, 2 TB (80 mg) / cup, and 3 cups / day, that's ~240 mg per day.
  - Intervention:  Simple Truth Organic Ground Coffe (unable to find caffeine content)
  - Cost / Benefit Analysis:

---

- EXP***:  BHB (salt) / MCT oil supplement
  - would rather get minerals (electroyltes and vitamins) from raw sources (i.e. whole food) and try to avoid supplementation if possible; trying to avoid medications (prescribed or OTC)
  - not trying to loose more weight or suppress appetite, but I'm following up on effects of electrolyte (specifically magnesium) intake on blood pressure since mine is still a bit high.
  - a large benefit of supplementation (protein powder is a good example of this) is the convenience factor... you're paying for the convenience of dropping a scoop of power in a liquid and mixing it up rather than cooking, preparing, and cleaning a whole meal.
  - supplementation is (arguably) required at some point as well.  Depending on your age and / or how intensely you train, it's really REALLY hard to even get enough calories, let alone keep your macros in check, make sure you're getting adequate vitamin intake, and you're fueling your recovery with enough electrolytes and sleep; all while not spending most of your day in the kitchen.
  - So, my main interests in BHB supplementation is:  quick recovery between workouts (for when there are 2 / day), to add electorytes (without sugary sports drinks or artificial sweeteners), and examine effects of electorlyte intake on blood pressure.  Also, may help get back on track quicker from social / indulgent meals without sacrificing nutritional value (vitamin / mineral density).
  - If it helps supress my appetite a bit and holds me over to the next meal time, or time I'm near the kitchen (rather than having to splurge on convenience foods), that's an added bonus.
  - the down side is that BHB supplements can be fairly expensive, so I'm not sure about the intake or effective dosage levels, etc... I'm not super thrilled about the high sodium intake either so it might be relegated to expcetionally hard training days.  Raw ketone's don't have this, but they are not widely commercially available and VERY expensive ($15 / ounce!).
