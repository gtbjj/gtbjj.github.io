  - Folgers Breakfast Blend 40 mg / TB ([source](https://cspinet.org/eating-healthy/ingredients-of-concern/caffeine-chart)), though I usually drink Folgers Black Silk
  - I don't want to cut out coffee completely becasue frankly I enjoy it, and don't like water in my protein shakes
  - I'm hesitant towards decaf coffee (though not opposed to 1/2 caf) because frequently the decaffinating process changes the flaver (and I DO NOT like that)

  - Starting:  2 cups M-F (2 TB each) and 3 on weekend, but more recently 3 / day given 7 a.m. BJJ workouts and sometimes rock climbing in the same day (I've got to be ready when the weather is willing to cooperate).  At 40 mg / TB, 2 TB (80 mg) / cup, and 3 cups / day, that's ~240 mg per day.
  - Intervention:  Simple Truth Organic Ground Coffe (unable to find caffeine content)
