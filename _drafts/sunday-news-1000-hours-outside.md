A member of the [Kombat Kitchen](https://t.me/kombatkitchen) recently shared this organization, [1,000 Hours Outside](https://www.1000hoursoutside.com/blog/exposure-to-morning-sunlight), with me.  As you know, the Kombat Kitchen is all about helping people kick butt in their lives; in multiple facets of course.  So, I get super pumped  when I read things like:

```
1000 Hours Outside is a global movement designed for any age child (or adult) and any environment. Join the journey and watch your life transform before your eyes. Nature holds tremendous power for each and every one of us at any age or stage.
```

Continuing from the "[About Us](https://www.1000hoursoutside.com/about-us)" section of their website:

```
We track a lot of things these days - steps, calories, budgets, frequent flyer miles etc - why not track something so beneficial to our children as well? There are so many things that compete for our time so it's easy for something like this to get back-burnered. We found that if we spread these 4-6 hour chunks out over a few days (shooting for roughly 20 hours a week) it would take us to averaging about 1,000 hours of outside activity a year. That seems insane, maybe - we get it. But did you know the average American child spends 1,200 hours a year in front of screens? Now THAT seems insane to us, but hey, we get it - parenting is hard and sometimes those screens 'seem' like such a welcome reprieve from the chaos. We certainly are not militant about it and we don't take a  'no screens ever or you will surely die' approach either. But we would, quite vehemently, argue that nature- big, beautiful, bountiful nature - is the absolute and very BEST reprieve for you and your children. Honestly, they don't even compare!
```

**Now I'm really interested!**  It gets better.  Their most recent blog post is titled "[Exposure to Morning Sunlight Profoundly Affects Mood, Health, and Nighttime Sleep](https://www.1000hoursoutside.com/blog/exposure-to-morning-sunlight)."  Considering I just wrote an article on Vitamin D and immune function and the news topic before that was on socialization and mental health; we're right on track!

The article covers topics like:

* Sunlight helps you sleep at night ([1](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2290997/), [2](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/12480364/), [3](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/12480364/))
* Sunlight enhances your mood ([4](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2290997/))
* Sunglight helps you lose weight (http://www.scienceoflight.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/journal_pone_0092251.pdf)

The references are all to medical journals, unlike some (unfrotunately) *"health coaches"* I've seen citing only WebMD areticles who's only references are... to more internal WebMD articles (*science please....*).

They even have a [Free Advent Calendary](https://www.1000hoursoutside.com/blog/free-outdoor-advent-calendar) with different outdoor activities for your family.  Now, obviously I'm not going to condone the s'mores and maple syrup, but I can't argue with a program encouraging people -- especially young people and families -- to get outside and do things whether they're "active" or not.

In the Vitamin D article I referenced a study that showed simply spending time in nature alone (improves mood) or with other people (improves relationships) regardless of activity level; though as we all know exercise has massive benefits to our bodies and mood as well.

1,000 hours outside / year comes to about 20 - 30 minutes per day.  It has been said many, many times before, that as busy as our lives are (or as we think they are), if you can't find 30 minutes / day to make your life and body happier and healthier you've got more problems than you think.  Why not double down and use that 20 - 30 minutes to exercise or meditate to bood?!

Be warned, you may see some of these things in upcoming Kombat Kitchen challenges!

Get lost (in the woods/mountains),
