This post is, in part, a response to a recent Power Company Climbing podcast, [Common Sense Nutrition with Neely Quinn](http://www.powercompanyclimbing.com/blog/2017/5/22/episode-42-common-sense-nutrition-with-neely-quinn).  If Neely's name sound's familiar, it's probably because you've been all over her site [trainingbeta.com](https://trainingbeta.com).  Interstingly enough, I became familiar with her nutritional guidance from [Paleo Plan](http://www.paleoplan.com/) much before I was researching training climbing.  At any rate, here we go:

#### Podcast Reaction:

Neely's big question in the podcast is (after eating something); *How did that make you feel?*  To that end, there is a parenthetic (I believe), *... and how did you perform?*  Most of us know the basics:

- Drink more water
- Sleep more
- Eat more protein
- Eat more vegetables
- Etc...

Whether or not we do them is a completely different subject.  The overwhelming majority of people fail at fitness and nutrition goals (i.e. New Year's resolutions).  The same is true of training plans, and not just for climbing.

A lot of this has to do with complexity, shock, and our body and mind's resistance to change.  When we are overloaded with too many variables of change, we are certain to fail.  On the other hand, the longivew is to make small and sustainable changes.  

For example, pick on (**and only one**) thing that you know you can for sure do for 30 days.  If it feels "easy" and you don't have to think about it to do it, add one more thing.  If you're still needing to maintain a concentrated effort.  Do it for another 30 days and re-evaltuate.  Basically, establish a baseline, make a change, monitor the effect, evaluate, and please, stop counting calories.  

I'm not going to go into the calorie thing, but the internet is full of plenty of information about why that concept has caused far more harm than good.  I'll simply say that the government has been telling us to eat less and move more for 30 years and the only thing that has happened is that we've gotten (a lot) fatter (as a country).

Neely also emphasizes establishing a baseline.  It is true, that a lot of people don't know that the things they're eating are making them (feel) sick or, at best, proffering lack luster climbing performances.  Of course, there will always be outliers (think Skittles, Diet Coke, and IPAs), but I've seen several times where Neely has asked the question:  *No matter how hard those people are climbing, how much **better** could they do if they cleaned up their diet?*

#### Personal Experience:

Coming from a very atheletic bacground, my diet is certainly *not the weakest link* that holds my climbing  back.  After many years of trial and error, I'm usually able to stay at 8 - 12% body fat year round.  I know that I *could* drop to 6 or 7 percent, but the amount of mental and physical effort that would require (compared to the effect it would have on my climbing) simply wouldn't be worth ith.  Not even close.

Plus or minus some degrees of experimentations, I've been a Paleo-er for about five years now.  On any given week I stay about 80 - 90% pure paleo.  With some moderate indulgences, that allows me to keep my sanity, be happy, and focus on my climbing.

Nevertheless, there are somethings I'm working on:

- No drinking coffee after noon (mentionined in podcast)
- Decreasing coffee consumption to ~4 cups / weekday (mentioned in podcast)
- Keep indulgences dairy and gluten free

#### A Good Discussion:

One of my roommates is also very fitness and nutritionally minded.  Of course, he eats bread, grain, and pasta in plenty (which I am opposed to).  I have also lived (peacefully mind you) with a house full of Vegans.  So conversations like the below (with my roommate) can apply across a wide range of body types, genetics, and athletics.

First, he is a microbiologist and that largely informs his dietary decisions.  I, on the other hand, want to eat things that will not poison me, and allow me to perform well in the activities I enjoy.  I don't remember the exact content of that (one of many) long conversations, but the summary where we aggreed was solid information for anyone to head.

- *Building Blocks First:*  Stop smoking, stop or make an effort to avoid drinking (alcohol), stop drinking soda (regular or diet)
- *More Basic Blocks:*  Stop eating sugar, white grains, and hydrogenated oils.  Try that for one year, then...
- *Try This:*  Don't eat anything that doesn't grow.  If you can't kill, harvest, or procure it yourself, don't eat it.  Do that for another year, then...
- *Then, and only then:*  Can we argue about white potatoes, lechtins in beans, nightshade vegetables, and other trivially minute details of nutrition.
