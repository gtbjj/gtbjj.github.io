**Week 8**

6/9

* sodium cravings, seem to skate by on bare minimum (2,500 mg) with only minor cramps or none, but still don't feel great (fatigue, though could be due to increased training load)
* do athletes need drugs?  or how long / do I need to adapt to nearly doubling my training volume?  obviously sleep and diet are pretty well secured (especially without caffeine)

6/13

* ate two days worth of food, was really (not crazy, but really) hungry after work.  mindlessly started cooking and eating and habit had taken over to cook / eat a whole day's worth of food at once (kind of cool :D)
* plan: try and fast w/ coffee and electrolytes for a double fast in return
* have been training more than when I was competing, really double what I was training before lockdowns, let alone during; so the adjustment has caused some crazy things to happen

6/15

* fewer calories, but not longer fast.  trust your body.

**Week 9**

6/19

* observation from a friend I haven't seen in a few months:  "visibly" improved happiness and lighter spirits
