Long reflection posts never seem to live up to the expectation for me.  That is, I keep a running list of ideas to write about, but in my mind and as time passes, the ideas grow and change faster than I can flesh out the ideas in writing.  In short, I haven't stagnated enough to fixate on a "year in review" post because I haven't hit that plateau yet.  Things are still changing, if not improving, rapildy -- or at least my thoughts about them are.

At any rate, here is a list of BJJ "principles to live by" that I'll be compiling over the years:

2019:
- posture, posture, posture.... everywhere!
- head position
- break grips, keep grips
- inside leg control

2020:
- don't wait to pass -- initiate pass as soon as guard opens
- don't open your guard w/o breaking their posture
