mid year goal review:

- living circumstances "making sense" to become a gym rat rather than dirtbag
- reviewing annual progress towards short / medium goals 
  - Q1:  accomplished
  - Q2:  not even close, in gym much more than expected
  - Q3:  need new plan
- mark twight:  the secret = "do it regularly and try really hard"
  - do it regularly
    - easy metric, hours or days / week in gym
    - 7/9 = ~7.3 hours / wk in gym (9 wk avg)
    - 5 days / week in gym @ < 75 min
  - try really hard
    - work weakness / projects
    - subjective 1-5 scale each day (keep weekly average)
    - may well "try harder" on 2 grade lower anti-style than limit with your forte
- climbstrong novice, how many pitches enough volume in a day?
- daily volume has been the same for ~2 months, but days / week has increased, as well as daily average
- pcc < 25 routes / problems -> Quality > Quantity
