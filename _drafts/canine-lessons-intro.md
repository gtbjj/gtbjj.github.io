Like a repsonsible pet owner I tried with due diligence to prepare myself as best as possible for being a first time pet owner as an adult.  I tried to over prepare (which is impossible by the way) as much as I could before adopting my resuce, Dean -- a German Shepherd / Belgian Malinois mix.

Since our partnership began I've kept process notes on our training, adventures, and life together.  Being a rescue, and myself having some knowledge of his prior home (or rather the conditions they left him in at the shelter:  fleas, GI worms, and heartworms), Dean really had no where to go but up with me.  But, as my dog learns to learn and work, and I learn to teach, train, and handle there have been some things we (I) got really right and somethings we (I) got really wrong.

In the service of improving my skills as a handler and trainer as well as companion for my dog and, hell, just a point of reflection I want to pause and muse about those things.  The list seems to get longer each day, so I'm not really sure when this post will be published.  Shall it be, "things I learned the first *day / week / month / 3 months / 6 months / year*?"

Perhaps the most clear message is that with any luck I will continue to learn.  And thus, this post series is born.  I am not a dog professional trainer.  But I want an active, disciplined, engaged, and enthusiastic relationship with and life for my dog.  So, here it begins!
