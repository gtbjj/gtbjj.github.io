*"Eating healthy is expensive."*  That's the trope we hear all the time, from all different angles.  Will your grocery bill go up making better choices?  Yes.  What will you also probably spend **less** on?  Supplements, prescriptions, medical costs, eating out, bad habits (junk food, fast food, eating out, alcohol, etc...).

I hear this even more frequently on a carnivore diet, that *meat is expensive.*  However, when you consider the bio-availability (source) , calorie density (source), and nutrient density (source) of animal products, they're actually pretty cheap.  For example, I eat 2,500 - 3,000 calories / day.  Do you know how much (volume) 3,000 calories of spinach is?  An uncomfortable bloating amount!  Then I digress to the anti-nutrients (source) in plants that certainly make that bloat less "worth it."  Not to mention the cost of all that spinach!  Alas, I digress to the nutrient density and bio-availability points above.

Back on track, let's talk money.  In my first [30 day test of the carnivore diet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/13WCRykhYSVscl9QhU4B3CNdaC7-n2UEKnWZBDMZJoBs/edit?usp=sharing) I logged my all my food related costs.  This is important, not just groceries, but all food, drink, snacks, etc...  My paleo / keto food costs (conventionally grown) with supplements and eating out was $85 / week.  Switching to carnivore I stopped eating out, didn't have craving so I didn't need cheat meals, and didn't need any supplements (though I did look into this in the future), my cost was $66 / week!

So, there's that.  Next, let's break down the [grass fed vs. grain fed](https://carnivoreaurelius.com/grass-fed-vs-grain-fed/) argument.  Take, for example, my weekly grocery list:

* Eggs, 2 dozen
* Beef Kidney, 1 lb
* Beef Liver, 1 lb
* Ground Beef, 4 lbs
* Chuck Roast / Brisket, 4 lbs
* *NOTE:  This is slightly different than the grocery list used in the initial comparison above.*

Now, let's look at the grocery cost of those items at a conventional rate:
| Item               | Conventional|
|:------------------:|:-----------:|
| Eggs, 2 dozen      | $4          |
| Beef Kidney, 1 lb  | $1.5        |
| Beef Liver, 1 lb   | $3.5        |
| Ground Beef, 4 lbs | $14         |
| Chuck Roast, 4 lbs | $20         |
| **Total:**         | **$43**     |

Then, compare that to the cost of 100% grass fed and free range:
| Item               | Conventional | Grass Fed |
|:------------------:|:------------:|:---------:|
| Eggs, 2 dozen      | $4           | $10       |
| Beef Kidney, 1 lb  | $1.5         | $7        |
| Beef Liver, 1 lb   | $3.5         | $8        |
| Ground Beef, 4 lbs | $14          | $28       |
| Chuck Roast, 4 lbs | $20          | $40       |
| **Total:**         | **$43**      | **$93**   |

So, that's a little more than double, but you certainly don't have to go "all in all at once."  My opinion differs a little from [Ken Berry](https://www.instagram.com/kendberry.md) in that I'm not convinced that digressing to potted meats and hot dogs are a suitable alternative to conventional vegetables (I'm open to more information if anyone has any).  Nevertheless, the point remains.  Eating a "conventionally raised" carnivore diet is still more nutritious than a vegetarian diet and most certainly more so than a Standard American Diet.

> SIDE RANT:  Now, if you want to debate the ethics or "sustainability" of conventional livestock raising that is a bit of a different issues (compared to [sustainable agriculture](https://regenerationinternational.org/why-regenerative-agriculture/)).  However, the argument from vegans against **all animal rasing and / for consumption** doesn't hold up considering the [ecological effects of mono-cropping](), the animals killed and their ecosystems eradicated to clear the land (fields != forests), [green house gasses produced](http://blog.whiteoakpastures.com/blog/carbon-negative-grassfed-beef) (not counting those by the pharmaceutical industry, celebrity hype while flying around in private jets, and avocados shipped from Mexico!),

What's more is that you can see that the increase in cost is most significant with eggs and organs, so you might leave those off initially.  You could also consider pork (though it's harder to find "naturally" because a pig will eat just about anything) and chicken for cheaper alternatives to beef.  Personally I leave them off due to their more elevated Omega-6 to Omega-3 ratios (source).

In conclusion, there is a lot of "wiggle room" in your carnivore budget.  The suggestion I give to people is to buy as much grass fed as you can afford.  If that mean starting with your ground beef or whole chickens, that's fine.  If it takes you a year or several to develop financial stability or enough anecdotal evidence to go 100% grass fed, so be it.  The point is to do better than you were doing yesterday, or last week, or last year.

> A NOTE ON SUPPLEMENTS:  I have experimented with different electrolyte supplements like LMNT and Flyby Fuel, but usually stick to a glass-bottled spring water and Redmond Real Salt.  I have also experimented with grass fed whey protein (Muscle Feast), but even that upsets my stomach a bit really doesn't have much pay off on a carnivore diet -- e.g. you're getting plenty of amino acids and protein and even calcium if you add sardines and bone meal / broth (I make mine from scratch!).
