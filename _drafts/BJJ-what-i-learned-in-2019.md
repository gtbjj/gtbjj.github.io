#### Preface:

*Once upon a time...* I started a blog journaling my adventures in fighting and fitness.  That was almost 10 years ago.  This website actually started a person "How To / Wiki" for me to keep track of various tech projects I was working on (e.g. Linux troubleshooting, Android ROMs and kernels, Arch Linux packages, etc...).  Since then I haven't kept up with the blogsphere, as content and ideas seem to change faster than I have a chance to write them down.

Nevertheless, I'm drawing some inspiration Robb Wolf's ["My Training at (39,42,43,44,45,46)"](https://robbwolf.com/2018/02/28/my-training-at-46/) series.  It's the end of the year and that's a traditional time of reflection.  So, here goes!

#### BJJ Principles to Live By:

*"Rules are born of principles"*, a dear mentor once told me.  So, I'm starting a list of pinciples that will hopefully change and serve me well in the coming years of training.  Techniques can be manipulated and trend in effectiveness, but principles should serve you universally.  In other words, these are the "micro battles" that lead to the successful execution of techniques.  I think ithis is what some people refer to as "invisible jiu jitsu."

```
*In no particular order*

- posture, posture, posture.... everywhere!
- head position
- break grips, keep grips
- inside leg control
```

#### Journal:

**Biggest Contributors to Improvement (BJJ specific):**

- Matt Time:  You just have to get out there.  There are lots of things you can do to help your BJJ off the matt, but none of that matters if you can't ever get to the mat.  Obviously, training once per week gets you in a different place at the end of the year than training 5 times per week.  Equally as obvious is that two people can use those same 5 sessions / week very differently.  In 2019 I saw almost 300 hours of matt time.
- Film Study:  This is tricky.  I'm not talking about instructional videos (though I've spent many hours watching those too).  I'm talking about high level (EBI, ADCC, Polaris, etc...) competitions.  But, I'm not talking about watching them for entertainment (though I do do that too).  I'm talking baout turning the sound off and doing your own commentary.  That is, talking yourself, out loud, through the positions and asking and answering what you would try to do if you were in this or that position.  Obviously you'll be wrong sometimes, but you can pause, rewind, and try to analyze and learn how / why stuff works the way it does.


**Biggest Contributors to Improvement (non-specific):**

Really, the biggest things here was a focus on *recovery*!  Restarting my fight career at 31 means I was in a much different place than when I was 23.  Specifcally within the topic of recovery I'd have to give the biggest credit to:

- Nutrition:  I've eaten a primal / paleo diet for about the last 7 years, plus or minus some experimentation.  In December of 2018 I added keto macronutrient ratios to a paleo food list, paleo being my "quality control."  Getting my weight down to a comfortable place was the first step to getting back on the matt for me.  Once upon a yesteryear, before I started fighting I weight 204 lbs, quite a differnece from my 157 collegiate wresting weight.  Fighting and a little dieting effort saw me come down to the low 170s.  After I stopped fighting and focused on climbing, my weight bounced around from 170 - 180, mabye in the low 180s occasionally.  Typically now I walk around at under 170.  I stick to a paleo-keto diet.  I only drink occasionally at social events.  I save my "indulgences" for social events only, there is no junk food in my house and I don't buy any.  If I "need something sweet" I wait until the weekend and treat myself to some fruit and dark chocolate (70% minimum, preferably 80%).
- Sodium / Electrolytes:  I would have to say this is the most effective (and affordable!) supplement option for keto athletes.  At somepoint wihtin the past year I tried keeping my sodium to 1g / day since the American Heart Association recommends < 2g / day.  Guess what happened?  My food tasted terrible, I felt fatigued, cramped, and just awful.  Eating out was completely off the table, I had to pack and plan every snack, AND my blood pressure didn't change at all!  When I started using an electrolyte powder (cheaper and more effective than Gatorade / Powerade by the way), and heavily salting my food (total sodium consumption for me is around 5-6 g / day) my food tasted great, I wasn't cramping or fatigued, my food tasted great, and my blood pressure didn't change.  If you're curious about how this works, do some digging on Robb Wolf's website or on Perfekt Keto.
- Sleep:  I could throw this in here two, but really only in the last month or so have I really been trying to hammer out the details of not only getting more, but getting better sleep and playing with limiting my caffeine intake (e.g. something to the tune of 50mg a couple times per week, or 200mg once per week).

**Rolling Reflections: Weight:** The question "do I need to lose weight" is really three questions:  1) Am I assuming any unnecessary health risk? (eating junk food, smoking, alcohol, etc...) 2) Does my body perform how I want it to? (copetative sports, walk your dog, play with your grand/kids) 3) Do I like the way I look naked?  If you answered "yes" to all 3, or maybe even 2, then you don't need to lose weight!

**Rolling Reflections:  Belts / Competitions / Improvement**  What is your measuring stick?  When are you pushing it and when are you taking it easy?  If you're not in to winning medals, then belts shouldn't matter either.  Obviously this is easier said than done.  Full belt promotions don't come along often (once every 1-2 years at most).  External validation is comforting, valuable, and generally makes us feel good.  But, this sport is long and arduous and internal gratification is needed as well.  Why are you doing this?  What do you want to get from BJJ?  Are you getting there / that?  I want to compete in 2020, but 2019 was all about just getting back on the mat (more on that below).  However, I'm certain that I will ONLY compete if the experience is fun!  That is, I don't want to feel pressured to be doing it for someone else or for some external reason (e.g. to get promoted faster).  I know when I'm pushing it and when I'm slacking off in they gym.  What I want from BJJ is to be confident in my ability to defend myself and succeed in combat sports.  To do that I need to test myself regularly, either with uppper belts, at other gyms (open mat), or in competition.  It seems like my attention to promotion comes and goes.  It's a hard thing to NOT focus on since you literally touch, tie, and think about your belt every time you step on the mat.  However, a mature grappler knows that there is great variance within any given belt rank.  Does it feel like your coach / upper belts are playing with you, or do they "turn it up?"  Are you laning  more frequent / different sweeps or submissions?  Maybe you're just surviving longer against a vastly more skilled opponent.  You need to have your own measuring stick for success.  Don't be confined by someone else's.

**Rolling Reflections:  1 Minute Submissions:**  If you can submit someone in less than one minute, or they submit you in less than one minute, then the training isn't beneficial for either of you.  The submitter is not being tested, and the submitted is being overwhelmed.  In contrast, if you can / get submitted 2 times in say a 5 minute round, you got your butt kicked, but were probably actually trying to execute techniques rather than just fighting for your life.


#### The Year In Review:

unsolicited feedback from upper belts

      
#### Professor Rolls:

Again, what is your measuring stick?  One of the biggest and best lessons climbing taught me was how to use an external element to fight internal battles.  Sometimes consistent rolling partners are hard to come by, sometimes rolling with the same person too much makes you adapt specifically to their game (i.e. improving against them, but not necessarily overall).  Rolling with you professor, is always a (seemingly insurmountable) challenge.

- 3/23/19:  Stadnging only round, thrown around like a rag doll (literally)
- 6/10/19:  3 Taps (kimura and two others)
- 10/5/19:  3 Taps (triangle, kimura, bow choke), don't remember the earlier rolls clearly (or dates), it felt like he came after me much harder this time.  Every roll feels like I'm at maximal mental stimulation and constantly "fighting for my life" just to (try to) keep up.
  - defended HG pass to retain closed guard (was immediately passed and submitted)
  - defended triangle by standing up, was swept and eventually tapped
  - defended that bow choke for a second (at least had to take a second rock)
- 11/2/19:  2 rounds with professor, 1 round w/ Thomas
  - Round 1: 1 tap (americana off head-and-arm triangle), I had (relatively) good hand control on scrambles (e.g. turtling after faile recomposure attempts on his pass attmpts).  I also had a decent butterfly sweep attempt, I saw elevation of a leg, but got smashed to fuck beofer I could attack a leg.  I was able to anticipate / clear a peruvian necktie as well.
  - Round 2: 3 taps (bow choke, cross arm from top half, kimura).  The first round felt like a warm up and I felt like he really came after me this round.  As usual, my brain was running as fast as it could to "just keep up."  I'd been watching a lot of film and trying to predict moves and that seemed to help a bit.  Sometimes I was right, but only thinking one move or so ahead, but then reeling afther the counter-to-the-counter.
  - Round 3: 1 tap (americana from top deep half) I had a decent attempt on the deep half sweep (proper grips), but he swept back.  Feedback from Thomas:  my "jiujitsu is good", but posture sucks at some spots which makes the differnece (e.g. when I'm trying to pass, or sweep from bottom half (and get extended)).
- 11/23:  no taps, easily "bunny hopped" over XG and butterfly to pass, , let me roll the mount to his guard. a few sweeps, defended back well.
- 11/29
  - Round 1:  defended back well, no submissions, multiple knee on belly points
  - Round 2:  sub by armbar (from turtle), sub by straight ankle lock (saddle), attempted takedowns, got thrown, but "bounced" right back (literally))
- 12/24: armbar (after overhead sweep) and wristlock.  decent guard recovery.  poor recovery from side control
