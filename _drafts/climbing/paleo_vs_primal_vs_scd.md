Marginal, maybe even meaningless differneces between "paleo" and "primal"

The point here is just to compare cost / heath effectiveness

| Prescription | 30 Day Cost |
| ------------ | ----------- |
| Slow Carb Diet (book) | $150.8 |
| Slow Carb Diet (2016) | $354.22 |
| Paleo (70-75%, 2017) | $228.35 |
| Paleo (~90%, 2017) | $394 |
| Primal Blueprint (2017) | Start 8/18/17 |

4HB book CR 2010, w/o binge days?; 2016 trial was all inclsive (binge, diet soda, coffee, cinnamon supplements)

70-75 "paleo" had rice, beans, white potatoes, deli / processed meat, whey, cheese, low quality produce / animals
