Preface:  This post was drafted last winter, when I was training hard for maximum strength.  However, the season passed before I published.  So, it's waiting for the next 'try hard' season to be more relevant to readers.
~~~

This post gleans it's inspiration again from Kris Hampton's Power Company Climbing blog / podcasts; this time related to [limit 
bouldering](http://www.powercompanyclimbing.com/blog/2016/9/5/video-a-more-in-depth-look-at-limit-bouldering).  The video is short compraed to 
his podcasts, but there is a tone of great information in there that you may or may not have thought about before.

Some of the take home points for me include the following:

*Warm Up... Really*

> I'm guilty of this too, it's either "ain't nobody got time for a rpopper warm up" or "some hodge-podge lollygagging on jugs."  Of course you 
want to start slow, but as Kris points out, if you're a V8 climber and you're warm up stops on V5s, you really haven't gotten warmed up yet.  
I've noticed this in hangboard sessions as well.  I think I'm warm, but need a set or two on hard holds before my mind and body are on the same 
page and really ready to go.  A climbing specific suggestion may be warm up through one attempt on maybe your Max -1.

*Work Your 5-Move Max*

> This will be covered in another very detailed post about energy systems, but fits here as well.  You may fail on a move because it's hard.  
You may also fail because there were 10  moves before a somewhat hard move and that is where you fall.  Really getting stronger means not 
waisting time in the middle ground.  So, climb into the crux section of a limit level problem, or just try the first 5 moves of your Max +1 or 
+2.  The important thing to remember is that a 5 move powerful crimpy line on a flat wall and a long, steep, roofy jug haul are not the same 
thing.  If you want to get stronger, find things that you're failing at because you're not strong enough, not because you're tired (pumped).  
Then practice it.  Sometimes success comes one move at a time, not a whole redpoint at a time.

*Use Every Advantage*

> If you've got a partner, don't let your ego get in the way of asking for a power spot.  Also, remember that there is no cheating in climbing, 
only lying.  So, if you need to do a move with a slightly better or closer hand / foot to practice the movement.  Do it!  Isn't that the point 
of a gym?  To have options and friends and to train for climbing outdoors? For me it is.

*Rest... a lot*

> (Resisting urge to talk about energy systems)  Don't we all know it's so easy to fall, (think you) know what you did wrong and hop right back 
on?  Somewhere out there I read a rule of thumb stating ~1 minute of rest per hard move.  Obviously that's just a ballpark estimate.  If you 
did 5 really hard moves you may very well need 5 minutes or more of rest before your physically and mentally really ready to give it your all 
again.  Conversely "if you're just trying to pull your butt off the ground you may only need 30 seconds of rest."  Bouldering is far more 
falling than sending, and probably proportionately more resting than climbing.  Gurus, hardmen, and crushers reading; does that sound about 
right?  In another post Kris suggests taking your shoes off between hard goes to force a bit more rest by necessity of taking a bit more time 
to put them on, etc...

*The 15 Minute Rule*

> I was actually talkint to some other clmibers about this recently before watching Hampton's video.  15 minutes, like many things in our 
sport, is subjective.  However, the point is to not spend too much time thrashing on any one particular problem / set of moves.  Obviously 
style can make a differnece in your perception of "how good" you are.  Work a 5-move sequence for a bit, then move on before it gets stale.  In 
a gym or a volume crag day, my comrades and I had a consensus of about 5 hard goes (after 2 or 3 fudgy ones) per problem then move on.  Goal 3 
of climbing is to send hard, Goal 2 is to have fun (Goal 1 is to stay alive!).

*Know When to Quit*

> Similar to the above, cut your sessions when you start to see a decline in progress.  At that point you're dipping into an endurance energy 
system which is fine, but this post is about climbing at your limit.  Kris uses the figure 85% (here or in another post).  If you're a V10 
climer that means you can pick a benchmark problem / move that's a stout V8.  Since I'm neither a V10 or a V8 climber I need to scale things 
down or find another method.  So, perhaps, a moderately hard move (similar in style to what you've been training that day) that you feel like 
you can stick 8 / 10 times on average.  If you're a regular at a gym, you probably don't even need to count.  You can guesstimate fairly easliy 
the problems and some individual moves that you can stick *not at all (yet)*, *rarely*, *sometimes*, *most times*, *almost always*.  Shouldn't 
those be the only 5 boudlering grades!? :-D
