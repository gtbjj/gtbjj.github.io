Like many climbers, I've spent years jumping around from the latest and greatest training protocols found in *Climbing Magazing* and *Rock and Ice* or who knows where online or in half a dozen (very well written an informative) published books.  I hoped this insight and wisdom would somehow give me an inside track to performing well.  While I can't say that it "hurt" anything, it certainly did not produce *fast* result.  The art of rock climbing and subsequent art of improvement has been an arduous task to say the least.

One of the hardest things to do when training is **keep the plan the plan**.  I'm as guilty as anyone of becoming *that guy* who has read everything and knows everything about climbing training -- thus, wanting to add a little of this or that, assuming I've amassed more knowledge than professional coaches and trainers.

So, two months ago, after having 500+ outdoor ascents under my belt, I sat down to re-read (at least for the third time) [the novice training program by Steve Bechtel](https://www.climbstrong.com/articles/20150515).  But, I had a specific intention this time around.  I want to start from the ground up, do the routine exactly as prescribed, and provide a fair evaluation (of the program and my current state as a climber).  Here is what happened.

#### Plan Summary:

**Weeks 1 - 3:**  Increase volume (number of problems) and intensity (sum of problem grades / number of problems) from week-to-week

**Week 4:**  Maintain intensity of Week 3 at half the volume of Week 3.

**Weeks 5 - 7:**  Repeat Weeks 1 - 3.

**Week 8:**  Maintain intensity of Week 7 at half the volume of Week 7.

*Initial Notes:*

- "Pieceing" a problem together counts.  "The goal is to monitor / record work done, not reaching an arbitrary stopping point."
- "Soft / Stout" grades - discussed below
- "Repeats / Style" routes - discussed below
- Start with climbing gym 3 days / week + 1 day with ~ 30 minutes of yoga (for relaxation, fun, recovery, and injury prevention)
- Session length:  Previous training logs tell me that 90 minute sessions are too hard to recover from in 2 days, so initial length set to 60 - 75 min (see notes below)
- Outdoor Climbing:  Tentative plans for 1 trip / month during "rest" (low volume) week.

#### Other Constants:

**Diet:**  Generally my diet stays around 80-90% paleo which is a good year-round balance for me to allow some indulgences and keep my sanity.

**Diet / Recovery:**  Starting with week 5 I made an intention to try and not drink coffee after noon.  See *recovery* notes below.

#### Progress Reports:

**Week 1:**

V-Avg: 3.091, No. Problems: 32

**Week 4:**

V-Avg: 3.727, No. Problems: 11

> After establishing a baseline week 1, I found that the "sweet spot" for amassing difficulty and volume was about 1 grade above my onsight level.  Statistically this looks like a "regression to the mean", or as Steve Bechtel describes it, [go medium](https://www.climbstrong.com/articles/20150724).  I also noted the need to remind myself to not overhtink a progression.  Given the above Onsight+1 formula, I simply wanted to complete one "hard" problem more each day this week than the pervious week.

**Week 5:**

V-Avg: 3.742, No. Problems: 31

> Noted aching hands (1/5).  Aroudn this time I had to remind myself daily that "what I'm doing is working, what I'm doing is working, what I'm doing is working..." and that I need to fight the urge to change things.  *Keep the plan the plan.*

**Week 6:**

V-Avg: 4.079, No. Problems: 38

> It's getting hard to maintain intensity while increasing voluem.  Session length limit increased to 90 minutes -- endurance seems suffciently built.  Elbows enflamed (2/5).

**Week 7:**

V-Avg: 4.25, No. Problems: 44

> Elbows enflamed (2/5).  I need more explicit focus on recovery.  *It's a strange and wonderful paradox to put more mental effort into recovery protocols than training!*  We should all know that *we get stronger when we rest, not when we train.*  Use "common sense" or "building blocks" recovery method (like diet):  eating right?  eating enough?  meal timing (beofore and after workout)? sleeping enough?  stretching?

**Week 8:**

V-Avg: 4.65, No. Problems: 20

> It's a "rest" week, but the stoke is high.  That needs special attention and balance.  The temptation to change things is even stronger now, but *what I'm doing is working.*  I've never been stronger -- that is balance between mental confidence and physical production of results.  Now, there's even more need to focus on recovery.  I started tracking how many hours of sleep I'm getting per week.

#### Summary:  Review and Reflections

**Simplicity is key:**  I love the simplicity of this plan.  "Easy" to implemnt procedures are key for sustained adherence.  This plan is effective, still allows you to be social and have fun at the gym, and doesn't needlessly sap mental energy.  Win!

**Micro Goals:**  I also liked that this plan motivated me to focus on a small, but not too smal picture through weekly goals /  objectives.  Anything can happen on any given day -- you're sick, you have to work late, psych is low, blame the route setters -- so that's a bit too neurotic to fuss about.  However, focusing on *just doing a little better this week than last week* produced quite good results as well as progress towards longer term goals.

**Balance:**  The next evolution of this training program is [the simplest training plan](https://www.climbstrong.com/articles/20130113_1).  The *crux* of training modalities seems to be balancing strength and endurance, particularly if you're a multi-dimensional climber (which you should be!).  Shall we train to be a **one-move-hero** that's only good for 10 feet of climbing, or **day-long-jug-hauler** that can thug it out on the steep for days but can't crimp to save his life?  This program allows for a bit of both.  Building endurance in the three weeks of "regular training" means I'm not tired at the crux of projects that I might be trying when it comes to the low-volume week.  

**Volume Corrects, but Honesty Goes Further:**  You may scope a route in the gym that is "soft" or "just your style" and exploit it to fluff your stats on a program like this.  Stone doesn't lie though.  The numbers I presented here aren't for bragging rights, they're just numbers.  Go ahead and run laps on your favorite crimp-de-la-crimp problem if that's your forte.  For one, if it's anywhere close to your limit (that is, if you're trying hard) the third or fourth round will should feel "adequately impossible."  Two, if your gym's setters are worth a darn, the likelihood of an unusually eash or hard problem of any grade should be about the same.  Three, if there's any kind of regular setting in your gym, that bread-and-butter problem of yours won't be around forever and will eventually be replaced by your antithesis.  Four, the more hold types and wall angles you can expose yourself to, the more you can keep your ego in check and the better you'll be prepared no matter how "soft" / "stout" a problem is.

**On Being a Novice:**  It is a good thing.  It means you still have a lot of room to grow and to improve.  It means you haven't yet begun to approach your genetic limit for a given task.

**Gym Requirement:**  I've tried this program before, but without a gym mebership it was a bust.  It's far too dificult to compare indoor and outdoor climbing and different styles ontop of that (e.g. I've worked way harder on a 5.10a trad line than any V3 I've warmed up on in they gym).  A gym isn't a requirement, but consistent metrics are.  We all know that "grades are subjective."

**Bottom Line:**  Just try a little harder, a little more often, everytime.
