Constants:
- diet: 80 - 90% paleo, ~ 1 indulgent meal per week, < 2 alcoholic drinks
- starting month 2:  no coffee after noon (limit 6 cups before)

Program:
- increase weekly volume (number of problems)
- increse weekly intensity (average problem grade)
- every 4th week, do half volume of previous week
- "piecing" a problem counts - "tracking work d one not an arbitrary stopping point"

Initial Notes:
- start w/ 3 days / week in gym
- 1 x 30 min yoga session per week (injury proofing + meditation + fun)
- in my experience, 90 min session area too hard to recover from in 2 days, keep training sessions to < 75 min
- plan outdoor climbing ~ 1 / month

Progress Notes:
- week 4
  - regression to the mean
  - "go medium" link
  - don't overthink the progression:  try one more "hard" problem each day that week
- week 5
  - hands hurt 1/5
  - keep the plan the plan, "what you're doing is working, what you're doing is working"
- week 6
  - getting hard to maintain volume and intesnity, increase sessions to 90 min limit
  - elbows enflamed 2/6
- week 7
  - elbows enflamed 2/6
  - need more explicit focus on recovery (try to sleep 9 hours, track days)
  - "common sense" recovery / building blocks like w/ nutrition
  - eat someting light before workout and w/in 30 min after


Final Notes:
- love the simplicity
  - effectiveness
  - non-neurotic / energy drain
  - micro daily / weekly goals
  - statistics?
  - day-long jug hauler vs. one-move-hero
- volume corrects, but honesty goes further
  - extorting soft / style preferences
  - resets w/ enough volume
  - bottom line try hard and try to try a little harder a little more often
