https://resources.strategiccoach.com/tools-and-worksheets/first-100-days

Morale (Pride): *Winning achievements?*

Momentum (Confidence): *What's working right now?*

Motivation (Excitement):  *Bigger and Better, What are you looking forward to?*


This post is actually pre-req for some of the "change maker" material

* bracketing investments / education
* evaluating audience and "jobs to be done"

### Reputation

**Unimpeachable Credentials:**

* Current: MA, LPC, PN1
* Weakness: business, exercise science, specific nutrition / medical training

Obviously this gets into the "bracketing" education that I'll talk about later, but as a primer, I'm not lacking in the "coaching" side of things with over 5 years in direct care mental health, a Master's Degree, and a license to practice counseling independently.

A PN1 is a good starting credential as I feel it's a rock solid foundation to start from, but one are for improvement would be something more specialized, say low-carb or performance related, though not necessarily (yet) as specific as pharmacology, lipidology, or neurochemistry.

Similarly, business is an area that I need the  most work in, though it's more relevant to my functioning rather than my reputation (others' perception).  This also dips into the *Morale / Excitement* section.

**Deliver Awesomeness:**

*Gather Reviews!*

* Multiple < 10 lb weight losses, multiple anecdotes about reduced inflammation / bloat and having more energy.
* Rick down 30 lbs > got first "real adult job"
* Cameron performance? (energy, wellness, check reviews about meat)

**Be Consistent, Kind, and Transparent:**

* change maker post series
* weekly polls / feedback on IG
* picky about who I affiliate with / what is **their reputation?**
