Cas and Link travel to the nearby town of Havelwood after having completed their task in [The Mad Manor of Astabar]({% post_url %}). Just outside 
the town gates they find a merchant named Phil with whom they decide to do business with in order to gain new equiment (armor and weapons and such).  
Phil sells them several pieces of equipment and shows interest in the magic box that Cas and Link have brought from the manor.  Successful charisma 
application by Link convinces Phil to investigate the box without haggling, stealing, or conning Link and Cas.

~~~
Phil:  It's magic alright... and sealed up tight too.  It doesn't look 
there's any place for a physical key of any kind.  But, the grooves 
here look funny, like it's meant to be put inside something else.  Heck, 
maybe you've found the key! (laughs)  I got no use for it though.  Here 
ya go kid. (tosses box back to Link)

~~~

Phil also informs the pair that there is a group of adventurers gathering at 
The Tavern Inn in Havelwood.  Since Cas and Link look like the adventuring type, 
Phil says they're robably interested in what's going on.

To The Tavern Inn they go and there they find a crowded bar room and only catch 
a whisper or two about some kind of cave.  Wanting to find out more information 
about this "cave" the pair hail a wench who informs them that there is an 
annual adventure to the Cave of Wonders and that it will begin this eve. She says 
that the cave opens for 24 hours one time per year and that none have ever returned 
alive.

Link notices a small pseudodragon trying to peck at the magic box from the manor (which is in his pack).  
The dragon flies away out the window.  Link's beast connection has no effect... apparently the dragon has 
stronger loyalties elsewhere.  Cas tells Link that he's too drunk and needs to stay put while Cas investigates where 
the dragon got off too.  

In the meantime Link is approached by a hooded woman who states:

~~~
Hooded Woman:  Hello there... are you, perhaps traveling to the Cave of 
Wonders?

Link:  Uh.. well... I'm not sure yet.

Hooded Woman:  I see... I saw you come down from the Mad Manor estate.  
Tell me, what did you find there?

Link:  (pauses) What business is that of yours?

Hooded Woman:  (using her exceptional charisma and Link's intoxicated 
state to her advantage) I'm just curious about the travels and tales 
told from one adventurer to another.  Surely a great warrior such as 
yourself was able to attain a great reward within the manor.

Link:  (tells her about the magic box)

Hooded Woman:  Oh I see... That is, indeed, very interesting.  Perhaps 
we will see each other in the Cave of Wonders... or not.
~~~

Cas comes barging back through the crowd.  He was unable to track the pseudodragon and, 
aware of Link's state, had been trying to get back through the crowd to stop him from 
talking to the hooded woman.  As he arrives back to the bar, the pseudodragon he'd been 
chasing lands on the hooded woman's shoulder as she walks away.

The bartender rallies the adventurers hand hands out a map to The Cave of Wonders and 
informs all that the annual adventure begins at sunset which is in one hour.  As the 
adventurers gather outside the cave a while later, Cas and Link notice that the hooded 
woman is indeed in attendance.
