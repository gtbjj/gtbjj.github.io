<!-- 
DM Notes:
- designed to level up before Ellion Castle Quest
-->

#### History:
- Kokiri (with Link) live peacefully in Kokiri Forest
- protected by patron diety [The Great Deku Tree](http://zelda.gamepedia.com/Great_Deku_Tree), a [treant](https://chisaipete.github.io/bestiary/creatures/treant)
- tree dies and land overrun with monsters
- Link returns as adult and plants new tree, which tells him about his parents

##### Objectives:

- Objecetive 1: Travel to Deku Tree remains
  - Entrance:  Kokiri encampment guarded by 3 gnolls + gnoll captain
  - Filler: Navi Says
    - Does not recognize 'this Link', but after 'her Link' left, a [Vampire Spellcaster](mm 298) came for Master Sword
    - [Saria](http://zelda.gamepedia.com/Saria) and Deku Tree sacrificed selves to seal Vampire in [Forest Temple](http://zelda.gamepedia.com/Forest_Temple_(Ocarina_of_Time))
    - Drow Mage came (w/ vampire's sired spawn) to free, couldn't open temple, burned forrest
    - Navi says there's rumors of some life still existing in charred stump of Deku tree
    - then she too fades away
  - Role Playing:
    - Find Deeku Tree stump
    - Find Spirit Stones (3, DC 15) burried by stump
    - Place stones on top of stump
    - Play Ocarina of Time
  - Room 5: 
    - Deku tree is barely brought back to life
    - Reminds Link that his father was a half-elf knight of Hyrule
    - Reminds Link that his mother was a Hylian Elf (LN), he is not a Kokiri
    - Party can ask 3 questions, then Deku tree will die again
- Rumor 1:  If Link asks about parents, mother had a strong relationship with faerie folk
- Objective 2: Find Hyrule, Negotiate with Archmage
  - Room 1:  Paths 1,3,5 lead to traps; 2,4 converege, lead to 2 x werewolves
  - Room 2: negotiate to send troops (30 knights + Archmage) to battle drow mage
    - need to protect town now, but playing Ocarina will bring them on giant eagles
    - keep interrogating (not happy about horned friend):
      - DC 12 - Hylians and Kokiri have long history with Faerie folk, though sometimes spoiled, someother creatures allowed to live among Kokiri (like Link)
      - DC 15 - Some races have even mated with Faerie folk.  One such half-faerie human was once gifted a box of Faerie dust from the realm of Atlantis to take back to her home world.
      - DC 18 - However, one of her kin was a bit mad and made rings out of the dust that could transport creatures two and from world and realms (2 of each), sometimes loosthing primordial evils upon other world accidentally
    - keep interrogating:
      - DC 12 - Who guards the rings: Suspect Vampire Spellcaster (CR15), Androsphinx (CR17) + Mummy Lord (CR16), Solar (CR21), unknonw (cas history)
      - DC 15 - Where to find them: Kokiri Forest, Dry Steppes, unknown, unknown
      - DC 18 - Why did  Link leave (Deku tree told him to leave and find his purpose, but weaving and reworking time obscured reality and caused mystreious riffs for things to "fall" in an out of the forrest world)
  - Room 5:  Troll attacks town on the way out
- Rumor 2:  Link's father didn't die in combat, may have succomb to dark forces; though some brave mortal men tried to stop / save him (Cas mother / father / family)
