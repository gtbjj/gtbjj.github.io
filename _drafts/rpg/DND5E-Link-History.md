#### Objectives / Rumors:
- Objective 2:  Travel to Kokiri Forest and find Deku Tree
- Objective 3:  Travel to Hyrule and negotiate with Archmage
- Rumor 1:  Bartender: Falling star (falling angel) crased through cathedral several years ago, may travelers tried to find its source, but
            after easier loot was robbed dry, there were too few survivors of the deeper catherdal layers and people stopped looking.
- Rumor 2:  [If Link asks Deku tree about parents] mother had a strong relationship with faerie folk
- Rumor 3:  Link's father didn't die in combat, may have succomb to dark forces; though some brave mortal men tried to stop / save him (Cas mother / father / family)
- Romor 4:  Where is Link's mother?  In bow?

#### Locations:
- Tristram (start):
  - "Tristram / New Tristram was founded and built on the ruins of Old Tristram after the town's drakening and eventual distruction as well as 
     the subesequent defeat of the Prime Evils.  Originally, simply a collection of merchants looking to profit on adventures and travelers 
     drawn by legends of riches, it slowly set down roots and became and established town."
- Ensteig (check comparison to Hyrule w/ Josh):
  - "This, mountainous forests blanket Entsteig, and it is a proud kingdom that has pledged its loyalties to the Zakarum fail.
    However, faith in the light is mixed with paganistic beliefs, and its people belive the Sharval Wilds to be an enchanted place of fey spirits.
    Goblins and dragons feature in Entsteig folklore."

#### Encounters:
