#### Ongoing Question / Rumors / Hooks:

- Where did Digoria hire Balfador and Alodel to go / do?
- Tomb of Queen Paragrin (in mines beneath Ogelstein) sealed by magic, never opened
- Tristram Cathedral had a "fallen star" crash into it, apparently great power, but may evils plauged the area and adventurers eventually gave up task.

#### Balance:

| LG (Link human fam?) | NG (Link)   | CG (Cas)         |
| LN (Link elf fam)    | N           | CN (Digoria)     |
| LE (Jadis, Cain)     | NE (Ellion) | CE (Phage) |

#### Future Plots / Hooks:

  - Cain is displeased with Ellion's inability to control captains
  - Ellion pleads that he can get souls for Cain by posing as a preist of Lolth and participating in her culls of the weak
  - Cain lets him live
  - Eventually Lolth finds out, kills Ellion, forms alliance with Yeenoghu to retaliate against Cain 

- Cas character development
  - incorporate outsiders (he speaks celestial)
  - wife / family / kids killed in some catastrophe and he survived

- eventual clash between Digoria and Cas / Link
  - "you deny your weapon its purpose"
  - "you have one fundamental flaw.  deep down inside, you're a good person.  deep down inside, I'm not."
