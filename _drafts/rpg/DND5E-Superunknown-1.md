  - corros is even less trusting of Digoria, orders underling to follow her around down and keep watch.  "Attempts to decieve him are foolhardy, but admirable... in a sense."  He says she has the character of a rogue, which seems incongruent with the brutish style of a fighter."  He offers for her to read books on famous rougues, their characteristics and fighting styles as well as work with the gueards and scouts to practice the skills (at 1/2 level penalty for 2 levels per fighter levels).  He seems to imply that he knows something of her past, but does not explicitly state so.
  
  Digoria is suspicious of Corros:
- says purpose of scrimmage wasn't to beat him, but to test his skills.  She knew he wouldn't kill her because he needs her (and cas).
- Bigger question is why?  Surely he could have killed a drow mage long ago.  Must be hinding something since everyone knows elves hate drow.
- What about the Kokiri forrest?  I Corros scared of whoever Ellion is working under or become affiliated with?
- Digs will try and pursuade group to interrogate or defeat Corros.  She suggests summoning a demon to test his allegiance as she suspects him of hiding something (information).

Digs and Cas consider summoning a demon / angel to test Corros' allegiance, both opposed to the other's suggestion (alignment).  However, both agree that there's something suspcious about whatever Corros may be hiding.  They spend the night researching lore, specifically vampire spellcasters -- whom it seems Corros has good reason to fear / remain removed from.  Digs wants to (physically) interrogate Corros and kill him if necessary.  Tensions build with Cas, who tells Digs that Corros spared her life ("a mistake perhaps").  At any rate, group decides to approach Corros after sparring match.
