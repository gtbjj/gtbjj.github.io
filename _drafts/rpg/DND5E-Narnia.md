#### Preface:

~ 10 years before presents day

So the time had come when Digoria had entered through the wardrobe at 
beckoning of Jadis, The White Witch and Goddess of Charn.  Jadis, 
finding Digoria to be of a noble bloodline of sorcerers, yet incompetent 
in the ways of the sword, offers to train her in such a discipline. 
 
The price to be paid is that Digoria will seek out a ship in her home 
world, one that she has captianed prior (The Entropy Tide) and can 
travel between planes and realms.  Jadis states that at the end of all 
worlds in her realm, The Realm of narnia, a great lion ([Aslan](http://narnia.wikia.com/wiki/Aslan)), 
destroyed all creation.  

However, her "Deep Magic" is allegedly strong enough to persists beyond 
physical destruction.  Having been eternally defeated by Aslan, Jadis 
wishes to command The Entropy Tide so that she can wage eternal war 
against her nemisis, the chaotic evil god of her realm, [Tash](https://narnia.wikia.com/wiki/Tash) -- who she 
find repulsive.  

Jadis has further stated that only mage, every several generations, is 
capable of commanding The Entropy Tide, even whilst donning The Mempo of 
Twilight.  Additionally, Tash appears to have made a similar bid to a 
demigod from Digoria's realm (Cain, The Necromancer) whom has made an 
alliance with Digoria's drow mage nemesis, Ellion Stryfe.

While Digoria is eager to learn the sword, she is leary of such a 
powerful promise.  However, seeing as Jadis had, moments earlier banished 
Digoria's master from all existence (ethereal and corpreal)... Digoria 
does what she does best, whatever she needs to to survive.

Even now Jadis appears extremely powerful, capable of interplanar 
communication and transporting objects (other than herself) to / from 
realms and creating a pocket realm for her "force ghost" to reside in.  
She states, though, she exisists presently as only shard of her former 
glory.

#### Once Upon a Time in Charn:

Jadis is skpetical of Digoria and her alignment at first, but knows that 
the nature of her power, and thus has gone through painstaking efforts 
to bring Digoria to the pocket realm she has created.

As the two walk through the recreated versoin of Jadi's world Digoria 
looks around and finds the place to have a strange and morbid haunting 
beauty.  Her sense of the territory is that it is somewhere between a 
Winter Wonderland and a charnel house full of skeletal remains.  But, there 
are also fringes on the horizon, as if the world has not yet been 
completely created... half finished, or falling apart.

Jadis tells Digoria that there was once a river in The Wood Between Worlds 
that lead to her homeland of Charn.  She states that though the river 
dried up just before Aslan's undoing of the realm, Charn did not 
completely die.  Therefore, she remained partially connected to the 
world and has been able to use, what she calls 'Deep Magic from darker 
and much older days' to recreate the world she knew.

Jadis:  You see, young tiefling, true evil never dies.  So long as there 
is light, there exists a presences where it is absent."

Digoria:  Sounds charming...

Jadis:  All life has remained extinguished here until I brought you in.  
As you see, our sun, being of a much older realm, is larger, red, and 
very much colder than the sun of your world.

Digoria:  So, you've brought me here to train me to steal a ship for you?

Jadis:  Indeed, as I've explained.  I cannot yet transport a being of my 
status between realms.  A peasant, such as yourself, is a much more 
simple task.

Digoria:  So, where is that you come from Ms... us... Jadis?

Jadis:  Once, when all realms were young and even the Faerie folk were 
just learning to use magic, there were far fewer races in existence.  
I am of a royal heritage consisting of noble Storm Giants and the most 
powerful Djinn.

Digoria:  You're obviously very powerful in the ways of magic and 
skilled on the battlefield as well.  What is this 'training' going to 
cost me?  I don't suspect you're the type that has much use for gold?

Jadis:  Indeed... perhaps you are smarter than you appear.  You are 
correct.  I have no use for gold.  What I need is time, and bod... um
 (starts pacing), a vehicle.
