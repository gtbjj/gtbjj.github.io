#### Battle with Ellion

Tristram:

Castle:

Battle Royale:
- Room 1:  Recoup in a town, try to find whereabouts of Ellion
  - research opportunity for Cas (past), Digoria (Tal Rasha), Link (parents)
  - senate can't be seen (dc 20 for guards to let pass)
- Room 2:
  - after a couple days messenger brings a puzzle box (dc 15 top open)
    - contents?
  - rumors that a Flind has been seen in snooping around the dessert hills
- Room 3:
  - guards are slain in morning, blood arrow pointing to desserd and one word, "dawn"
- Room 4:
  - Open dessert plane
  - 100 Ghouls + Drow Priest(ess) of Lolth
  - Corros sends 20 knights on 20 giant eagles
  - at least 50% of ghouls must be dead before attacking Ellion
  - Ellion will only use AOE / buff / debuff spells until then
  - if Ellion wins
    - remaining ghouls (horde health %) / 2 = number of driders that attack ghouls
    - he is written with thoughts being attacked by swarms of spiders
  - if Players win
    - Ellion tries to barter:  says there's a Skeleton King, a Lich, haunting the Tirstram cathedral and he "has what you (Digoria) seek"
    - he knows this because of diety assistance
    - if players try kill him, CON DC 20 to not be overwheled thoughts of being covered by spiders
    - if Ellion Wins:  he is petrified at sight of Karasou
      - says he was freed by his sire Phage (appears w/ Oni) after she learned of his betrayal
    
    
    
  - Tall woman clad in black (Loth) slowly approaches Ellion, speaking in all tongues.
  - makes his body freeze
  - Speaks in commone:  "knows of Ellion's betrayal to her and his loyalty to the necromancer, Cain."
  - Found out from Yeenoghu (presides over, not just gnolls, but ghouls as well)
  - makes him impale himself, then grabs face and withers him away to ethereal nothingness
  - Cain appears, ready to fight Lolth with an undead army
  - Yeenoghu appears ripping through ghouls, ghast, and undead, and is on Lolth's side
  - Cain initially tries to fight, but is outgunned and casts massive darkness spell to escape
- Room 5:
  - fight way out through X monsters (x = however many ghouls left; 1/2 ghouls, 1/2 gnolls)
  - Return to Ensteig

Location / Objective 5: Corros
- Says crew has failed and will not help them further, ill temper showing
- Cha 15 can persuade corros to enter a duel
- assassin (CR 8) will attack Corros if you can get him to 50 hp
  - can be interrogated (dc 15), Yeenoghu sent
- a second joins assassin if Corros < 25 hp
- assassins says they've gained attention of Yeenoghou and Lolth and that there is an underwold tournament of evils within the Abyss, that the prior war was "little more than a scrimmage" and they're not the only ones searching for the rings, that other powerful mages know of them and would love to bring inter-realm evils to this world as well -- or perhaps restore other primevils.
