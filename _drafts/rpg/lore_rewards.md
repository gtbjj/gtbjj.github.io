> **Digoria's Heritage**:  Tiefling sorcer mother, [Liliana Vess](https://i.imgur.com/DjmKELZ.jpg) had a brief and tempestuous relationship with an [elemental assassin](https://www.dandwiki.com/wiki/Elemental_Assassin_(5e_Class)), [Ral Zarek](https://i.imgur.com/KV4fssm.jpg).  Little is known of Ral, though he has been described as "brilliant, unpredictable, and daring" and having an affinity for lightning and storm, particularly of snow and ice.  Liliana's history, however is much more documented in lore and legends.  In spite of being at least a century old her appearance is that of an approximately 30 year old woman.  She has been known for her skill as a necromancer, reanimating the dead, corrupting the living, and unlocking the power of death.  "She is charismatic, witty, and prfoundly egocentric."  Throughout her ascent as a sorceress, she made a pact with four demons to secure her youth and power -- Kothophed, Griselbrand, Razaketh, and Belzenlok -- the result of each deal used to broker another.  She was given an opportunity to break her pact by the demon Kothophed by retrieving an artifact -- [The Chain Vail](https://www.dandwiki.com/wiki/The_Chain_Veil_(5e_Equipment)).  However, instead of handing it over, Liliana used the power of the veil to destroy the demon.  She was able to track down and kill Griselbrand [(source)](https://mtg.gamepedia.com/Liliana_Vess#Innistrad).  When Razaketh was confronted, he took control over Liliana's body, but assistance from other powerful planeswalkers broke Razaketh's concentration, allowing Liliana to reanimate the hordes of corpses sacrificed to Razaketh and commanded them to "tear him apart and feast on his remains ([source](https://mtg.gamepedia.com/Liliana_Vess#Amonkhet))."  The demon Belzenlok had truned Liliana's brother, Josu, into a lich to fight against her.  However, Liliana once again made a clever aliance with a strong planeswalker who rallied a small bastion of strong fighters to aid in the vanquishing of both Josu and Belzenlok ([source](https://mtg.gamepedia.com/Liliana_Vess#Return_to_Dominaria)).  Of last note, Liliana had "bitten of more than she could chew" at the hands of a mighty dragon lord and taken to hiding somewhere in the world of Sancturay, seeking protectionary pacts while she schemed a survival plan against the dragon.

> **Cosmology (Part III):  The Great Conflict, Part I "... was a war between the forces of heaven and hell.  It has since spilled over into the mortal realm.  The war was initially fought in Pandemonium over the Worldstone.  It is said that whoever controlled the Worldstone had the ability to shape reality and create life and worlds almost without restriction.  Sometimes the battle would reach the gates of the heavenly and hellish realms themselves.  While the Great Conflict burned hotter and longer than any of the stars in the sky, neither side could gain dominion over the other for long.  Both factions sought some way to turn the tides of the war to their favor.  Eventually the forces of hell (evil aligned outer planes) learned of the material plane.  Not wanting to attract the attention of hte heavens' they worked in secret to try to corrupt humanity.  Eventually the heavenes found out about the material plane as well and moved to destroy it for it's corruption.  The heavenes evnetually voted to spare the material plane and a truce was reached with the hellish armies:  both factions would respect the material plane's right to exist.  However, demons being demons, had no intention of honoring the truce."  (http://diablo.wikia.com/wiki/Eternal_Conflict)

> Tathmaht / Tiamat:"... was the second being to exist in Creation.  The counterart of Anu, its creation and death lead to the birth of hellish outer domains.  Anu was the first being in Creation and sought a state of toal purity and cast all evil from itself.  However, these elements coalesced into a single being:  Tathamet, a seven-headed dragon that was the sum total of all evil.  Though seaparate entities, Anu and Tathamet were bound within the Pear that contained them.  There they warred against each other in an unedning battle for ages uncounted.  Tathamet, along with Anu, died in the final battle they had against each other.  Tathamet's blackened, smoldering husk spiraled into the lower darkness of reality.  From his putrid flesh arose the evil outer realms and the races that arose from them.  Allegedly his three strongest maws gave birth to three greater evils while the four lesser birthed lesser ones.

A> The Entorpy Tide (needs work):  Ship of great power must always come at a great cost.  Though clearly heralding a necrotic energy from the seas, the exact origins of the ship are unknown.  However, Digoria is not the first captian, nor Ellion Stryfe.  Stryfe has suggested that Digoria's mother (assumed dead) was once captain of the ship.  Failing to uphold the bargain one strikes to gain captainhood of the ship results in becoming one of the mindless undead crew for all eternity.

> **Cosmology (part ?):  Pandemonium - "location of the sin war, 'scar' of separation between Anu and Tiamat"

> **The Entropy Tide (part II):**  The ship's name suggests, when the tide breaks, after radnomness has reached critical mass, chaos is loosed on the world.
