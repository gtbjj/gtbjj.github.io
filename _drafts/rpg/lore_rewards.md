> **Tathamet**:  "... was the second being to exist in Creation.  The counterart of Anu, its creation and death lead to the birth of hellish outer domains.  Anu was the first being in Creation and sought a state of toal purity and cast all evil from itself.  However, these elements coalesced into a single being:  Tathamet, a seven-headed dragon that was the sum total of all evil.  Though seaparate entities, Anu and Tathamet were bound within the Pear that contained them.  There they warred against each other in an unedning battle for ages uncounted.  Tathamet, along with Anu, died in the final battle they had against each other.  Tathamet's blackened, smoldering husk spiraled into the lower darkness of reality.  From his putrid flesh arose the evil outer realms and the races that arose from them.  Allegedly his three strongest maws gave birth to three greater evils while the four lesser birthed lesser ones.  ([reference](http://diablo.wikia.com/wiki/Tathamet))

> **Pandemonium**:  "... is one of the realms of creation lying in "neautral territory, a crossroads of domains, belonging completely neither to the burning hells (hellish territories) or the high heavens (heavenly good territories).  Pandemonium is signficiant because it represents a "scar" of the universe's violent birth due to the battle between Anu and Tathamet.  It posesses 'warped reality' traits.  At the center of Pandemonium lay the Wolrdstone.  It was for this object that the Great Conflict was waged by angles and demons and consequently, most of the conflict fought within Pandemonium itself.  Pandemonium is made entirely of rock pierced by innumerable tunnels and caverns large and small.  All open space is filled with howling winds that carried the sound of every word, shout, or scream uttered in the place.  Wihtout adequate protection, being with hearing were rendered temporarily deaf in a matter of seconds and permanently deaf in a few minutes.  Normal fires cannot survive here and there is no natural light.  This is the outer realm between chaotic neutral and chaotic evil."  ([reference 1](http://diablo.wikia.com/wiki/Pandemonium), [reference 2](http://forgottenrealms.wikia.com/wiki/Pandemonium))

> **The Great Conflict**:  "... was a war between the forces of heaven and hell.  It has since spilled over into the mortal realm.  The war was initially fought in Pandemonium over the Worldstone.  It is said that whoever controlled the Worldstone had the ability to shape reality and create life and worlds almost without restriction.  Sometimes the battle would reach the gates of the heavenly and hellish realms themselves.  While the Great Conflict burned hotter and longer than any of the stars in the sky, neither side could gain dominion over the other for long.  Both factions sought some way to turn the tides of the war to their favor.  Eventually the forces of hell (evil aligned outer planes) learned of the material plane.  Not wanting to attract the attention of hte heavens' they worked in secret to try to corrupt humanity.  Eventually the heavenes found out about the material plane as well and moved to destroy it for it's corruption.  The heavenes evnetually voted to spare the material plane and a truce was reached with the hellish armies:  both factions would respect the material plane's right to exist.  However, demons being demons, had no intention of honoring the truce." ([reference](http://diablo.wikia.com/wiki/Great_Conflict))


> **Cosmology (part ?)**:  In another age, there was a great battle between the high heavens and the burnging hells to claim the souls of humanity.  The outcome was a stalemate and the decision that this world, Sanctuary, would be left to decide it's own fate.  Bands of adventurers have battled many great evils time and time again here including Mephisto (lord of hatred), Diablo (lord of terror), Baal (lord of destruction), Andariel (maiden of anguish), Duriel (lord of pain), Belial (lord of lies), and Azmodan (lord of sin).

> **Cosmology (part ?):  Pandemonium - "location of the sin war, 'scar' of separation between Anu and Tiamat"

> **The Entropy Tide (part I)**:  A ship of great power must always come at a great cost.  Though clearly heralding a necrotic energy from the seas, the exact origins of the ship are unknown.  However, Digoria is not the first captian, nor Ellion Stryfe.  Stryfe has suggested that Digoria's mother (assumed dead) was once captain of the ship.  Failing to uphold the bargain one strikes to gain captainhood of the ship results in becoming one of the mindless undead crew for all eternity.

> **The Entropy Tide (part II):**  The ship's name suggests, when the tide breaks, after radnomness has reached critical mass, chaos is loosed on the world.
