#### Lore Rewards

> **Cosmology (part I)**:  In another age, there was a great battle between the high heavens and the burnging hells to claim the souls of humanity.  The outcome was a stalemate and the decision that this world, Sanctuary, would be left to decide it's own fate.  Bands of adventurers have battled many great evils time and time again here including Mephisto (lord of hatred), Diablo (lord of terror), Baal (lord of destruction), Andariel (maiden of anguish), Duriel (lord of pain), Belial (lord of lies), and Azmodan (lord of sin).

> **Cosmology (part II):  Pandemonium - "location of the sin war, 'scar' of separation between Anu and Tiamat"

> **The Entropy Tide (part I)**:  A ship of great power must always come at a great cost.  Though clearly heralding a necrotic energy from the seas, the exact origins of the ship are unknown.  However, Digoria is not the first captian, nor Ellion Stryfe.  Stryfe has suggested that Digoria's mother (assumed dead) was once captain of the ship.  Failing to uphold the bargain one strikes to gain captainhood of the ship results in becoming one of the mindless undead crew for all eternity.

> **The Entropy Tide (part II):**  The ship's name suggests, when the tide breaks, after radnomness has reached critical mass, chaos is loosed on the world.
