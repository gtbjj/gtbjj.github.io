> **Digoria's Heritage**:  Tiefling sorcer mother, [Liliana Vess](https://i.imgur.com/DjmKELZ.jpg) had a brief and tempestuous relationship with an [elemental assassin](https://www.dandwiki.com/wiki/Elemental_Assassin_(5e_Class)), [Ral Zarek](https://i.imgur.com/KV4fssm.jpg).  Little is known of Ral, though he has been described as "brilliant, unpredictable, and daring" and having an affinity for lightning and storm, particularly of snow and ice.  Liliana's history, however is much more documented in lore and legends.  In spite of being at least a century old her appearance is that of an approximately 30 year old woman.  She has been known for her skill as a necromancer, reanimating the dead, corrupting the living, and unlocking the power of death.  "She is charismatic, witty, and prfoundly egocentric."  Throughout her ascent as a sorceress, she made a pact with four demons to secure her youth and power -- Kothophed, Griselbrand, Razaketh, and Belzenlok -- the result of each deal used to broker another.  She was given an opportunity to break her pact by the demon Kothophed by retrieving an artifact -- [The Chain Vail](https://www.dandwiki.com/wiki/The_Chain_Veil_(5e_Equipment)).  However, instead of handing it over, Liliana used the power of the veil to destroy the demon.  She was able to track down and kill Griselbrand [(source)](https://mtg.gamepedia.com/Liliana_Vess#Innistrad).  When Razaketh was confronted, he took control over Liliana's body, but assistance from other powerful planeswalkers broke Razaketh's concentration, allowing Liliana to reanimate the hordes of corpses sacrificed to Razaketh and commanded them to "tear him apart and feast on his remains ([source](https://mtg.gamepedia.com/Liliana_Vess#Amonkhet))."  The demon Belzenlok had truned Liliana's brother, Josu, into a lich to fight against her.  However, Liliana once again made a clever aliance with a strong planeswalker who rallied a small bastion of strong fighters to aid in the vanquishing of both Josu and Belzenlok ([source](https://mtg.gamepedia.com/Liliana_Vess#Return_to_Dominaria)).  Of last note, Liliana had "bitten of more than she could chew" at the hands of a mighty dragon lord and taken to hiding somewhere in the world of Sancturay, seeking protectionary pacts while she schemed a survival plan against the dragon.


> **Cosmology (part ?)**:  In another age, there was a great battle between the high heavens and the burnging hells to claim the souls of humanity.  The outcome was a stalemate and the decision that this world, Sanctuary, would be left to decide it's own fate.  Bands of adventurers have battled many great evils time and time again here including Mephisto (lord of hatred), Diablo (lord of terror), Baal (lord of destruction), Andariel (maiden of anguish), Duriel (lord of pain), Belial (lord of lies), and Azmodan (lord of sin).

> **Cosmology (part ?):  Pandemonium - "location of the sin war, 'scar' of separation between Anu and Tiamat"

> **The Entropy Tide (part I)**:  A ship of great power must always come at a great cost.  Though clearly heralding a necrotic energy from the seas, the exact origins of the ship are unknown.  However, Digoria is not the first captian, nor Ellion Stryfe.  Stryfe has suggested that Digoria's mother (assumed dead) was once captain of the ship.  Failing to uphold the bargain one strikes to gain captainhood of the ship results in becoming one of the mindless undead crew for all eternity.

> **The Entropy Tide (part II):**  The ship's name suggests, when the tide breaks, after radnomness has reached critical mass, chaos is loosed on the world.
