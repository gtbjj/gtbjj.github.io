Description:  Digoria hired Balfador and Alodel to research how The Entropy Tide was created, as well as the wereabouts of Ellion Stryfe and whomever he may be working with to get his army.
- Quest Option 1:  Follow Fortune Teller
  - Need to find her in town (bartender will point her out for 100gp, or DC 15)
  - she leaves in 5 turns (DC 12 to notice)
  - follow through woods (can't catch); DC 18 to notice being followed by a 2 x gnoll
  - DC 10 to track, +1 / round
  - eventually end in Tristram (gnolls townsfolk)
  - "more evil" in house east of cathedral
  - one mimic (CR2), room w/ key to basement
  - other room w/ trapped floor (DC 10), DC 15 acrobatics to avoid fall (pit w/ 1 skel / player)
  - basement has 3 x cultists, cult fanatic attacks when ritual noticed
    - players have 10 rounds to disrupt ritual, additional Acolyte comes
      - success:
      - fail: Ellion appears, kills fortune teller w/ 3 headed flail, hords of gnolls appear and devour cultists (how to get out?)
- Quest Option 2:  Travel to Caldeum and search / steal information about The Entropy Tide
