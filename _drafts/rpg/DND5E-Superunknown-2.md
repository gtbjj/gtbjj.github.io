#### Digoria vs Phage
P - flies out window on broom
D - chases her to roof for battle
P - leaps from broom and bites D
D - unleashes quickened booming blade (3 swipes, all hearty hits) in a furry
P - blood curdling scream, claws miss due to digoria's haste
D - still in a rage, another quickened booming blade; snide comment "you've gained strength, but lost step never having learned the sword"
P - takes to flight on broom again to stay out of range of blade, "It's not by chance I've taken hold here.  While Ellion fights his war in the dessert, a pissing match between egos to open The Abyss, I've taken to his books on magic and hired an Oni -- who I'm sure is enteretaining your friends at the moment.  You're inate magic led you to the sword.  My inate carnage led me to occult magic -- a force that will usurp Ellion and even my master, once I've freed him and taken what I must.
D - Listens (while precious time wastes)
P - "When I first went to The Kokiri Forrest to free Karsu, I was little more than a henchman, kept at bay by the strength Ellion had gained through his worship of Lolth.  But, his loyalty to Cain meant not freeing another strong undead force -- my master.  I care not for the Master Sword he sought, but rather one of his more prized posessions... an Atlantian Faerie Ring.  Now, let me show you what I've come to learn!" --> casts hold person, paralyzes, leaps from broom, critical claws
D - can't move or speak, is grappled
P - "Did you really think an Oni would succomb to someone of lesser magic than he?  And paid hansomly from Ellion's vault for finishing your friends... and then?  Then Oni and I take to Entesteig to kill Corros so that I'm sure to have enough power to free and kill Karasu!"

Though it starts to rain, P squeezes and scratches and looks sinister at the paralyzed D though the rain inhibits her healing.  The air and the rain are still warm in the late fall, but a frigid bitter chill begins to seep through the air offering and other worldly aura of fear.
