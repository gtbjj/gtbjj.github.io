After the adventure in the [Cave of Wonders]() Cas, Digoria, and Link set sail upon a ship that Digoria had "rented" (though with no intention of returning) from a merchant.  While Cas isn't happy about this behavior, he agrees to accompany Digoria, believing that she has friends in high (and low) places that may be able to help in him in regaining his lost memories.

Link, unsure of his own history accompanies the party as well.  He states that he remembers leaving his homeland (though he can't recall anything about it) and meeting Cas in a tavern in Tristram while adventuring.  They struck up a friendship an when Cas did not quickly return from investigating rumors about a [haunted mansion](), Link pursued his friend.

At present, Digoria informs her aquiantences that the "map" is more of a "compass", except that instead of pointing North, it points to *a very special ship* which is what they are sailing towards.  While Link and Cas have agreed to accompany Digoria, they remain suspicious of her history, character, and motivation.

As the crew sails around the southwest islands, they draw close to one of hte smaller and notice that there are many wercked ships along the coast.  They also hear faint, soft music.  They crew decides to dock in a safe area and start exploring the beach area of the island.

Cas notices a couple [ogres](https://chisaipete.github.io/bestiary/creatures/ogre) fishing on the shore along the wreckage and he and Digoria decide to attack head on while Link sneaks along the rocks, bow readied.  After breif combat, the ogres are easily charred by Digoria's ligtning bolt.  Link, however, feels ill (he did, in fact drink quit a bit of wine and mead aboard the ship last night) and must retire back to the docked ship for rest, leaving Digoria and Cas to continue alone.

Upward, through the hills of the moutainous middle of the island they go as the music they heard upon docking grows ever more clear.
