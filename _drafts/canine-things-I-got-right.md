Gather as much information as you can (but be warned it is not all good information):

- Youtube (link playlist)
- blogs / websites
- forums

You will miss some things and that's okay
Things I didn't prepare for:
- how to get the dog home

breed to match my lifestyle (active, working / hobby)

shelter shopping and thrift store mentality, be wary of private sellers

Should you just go to a breeder ? - https://www.instagram.com/p/BmQ8XAoA6LA/?utm_source=ig_web_copy_link

- Week 1 (or more):  The only things you need to learn are:
  - I'm the boss
  - what "no" means
  - where we go potty

initial structure:   - we go to the bathroom 4x / day > we eat before we go to the bathroom to "get things moving"; great for learning how to learn

- Detective work (blinds and down jackets)

- willingness to learn and continue learning / have changed / removed videos from [trianing playlist](); adapted to weather and drives; keeping notes on what works for and doesn't work for me and my dog

- teaching him how to learn is a valuable skill

- becoming more careful about who I trust to give me information

- understanding people want different htings from their dogs

- vet / petstore / veteran compliments

- rainy days are great for "learning" versus training sessions and trying new things
