listen to your dog / weather

breaking drive / ego / taking the long view

temper / ego / physicality

socialization - means different things to different people

how we socialize - http://leerburg.com/socializepuppies.htm

roommates / housemates - dog lovers suck, it's not enough you both / all like dogs; there are very differeing views in how to train, raise, interact with, and teach your dog to interact with other people and dogs.  difficult to say if one way or another is more *right* or *wrong*, but sometimes they are certainly incompatible.  even worse, some folks don't have the appreciation to understand that you may want something different from and with your dog than they do.

you will have to be your dogs advocate / little dogs get away with things

bite / too much confidence too soon / skewed perception of proofing and socializing

balancing work and play for dog - initally had great focus, then "broken heeling"; nowadays our training sessions look more like *play with a little work mixed in* versus *working with all too little play mixed in.*  sometimes "just play" or "just go for a walk" -- compare to human athletes who train non-stop all the time.
