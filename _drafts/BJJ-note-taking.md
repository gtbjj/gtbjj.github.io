- I'm no stranger to training logs and spreadsheet wizardry
- The best plan is useless if you don't do it, so even keeping a log at all is helpful to get a few more *"mental reps"* in as you write things down.
- Speaking of writing - the physical act of writing (you know like pen and paper) involves more of your senses and has a more positive impact on memory.  However, see \#1.  You probably have your phone with you already, and probably check it relatively soon after training (texting, social media, etc...), so why not take some notes
- you could keep a spreadhseet, or there are dozens of notepad apps out there; marune link
- to get the most out of them, you need to read back on them


Note Formats:
- Chewy has many different journals, but not one for outlining techniques (anymore)
- [some sources](https://www.bjjselfhelp.com/taking-notes/) suggest outlining techniques so that you don't forget what you learned in class as yo uleave.  One way to help with this is to have an extra drill session; for me that looks osmething like T (class w/ new content), W (class w/ new content), R (class w/ review of T/W), F (trouble shoot and discuss positions I'm struggling wiht)
- with individual techniques comes "[shelving it for later](https://www.invertedgear.com/blogs/inverted-gear-blog/114574789-6-tips-for-taking-notes-in-jiu-jitsu)" or knowing when a technique is outside your wheelhouse and your notetaking efforts are better spent elsewhere.
- I do keep a separate description of my "go to" techniques in a "[Playbook Format](https://www.orlandobjj.com/uploads/2/1/1/9/21195504/belt_requirements.pdf)"

Trouble shooting:
- you know what you suck at even if you don't want to admit it
- A) write these things down
- B) take time to mentally think through them (visualization) or use YouTube for something useful and see how others have dealt with the problem.
- C) find a partner to work through the positions for you (not even drilling, just brainstorming in motion)
- D) do some positional sparrring related to the position(s)

My "Simple" Format looks like this:
- Hours training / rolling
- A **specific** weekly goal (e.g. drill 10 minutes after every class)
- A **small** and **specific** daily goal (e.g. only work top game)
- Any notes on injuries, how they're progressing / declining, or affecting performance
- Techniques or positions I felt strong in
- Techniques or postiions I got caught in or struggled with

In other words:  Effort (how hard did I try) + Impressions (how good or bad do I feel about the session) + Problems (injuries or things to work on in the future)
[reference](https://www.climbstrong.com/education-center/in-depth-how-to-keep-a-useful-training-log/)

- other mental reps:
  - on the commute back from the gym (45 min for me), drill the techniques you learned that day in your mind.  Or, spend the time troubleshooting and visualizing your way through different parts of different rounds where you struggled.
