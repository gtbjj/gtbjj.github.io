- EXP016:  blood pressure:  increase magnesium intake (replace red meat with fish, pumpkin seed 2oz / day), moderate sodium intake (< 1500 mg), see full nutrient profile(link)

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

**Take One:**

|        | Avg. Magnesium Intake | Blood Pressure, RHR |
| ------ |:---------------------:|:-------------------:|
| Start  | 42%                   | ~ 144 / 88, ~ 77    |
| Week 1 | [383 mg, 96% RDA](https://photos.app.goo.gl/Xn5StjnVBTjqKx1x7) | N/A |
| Week 2 | [251 mg, 63% RDA](https://photos.app.goo.gl/r5yjVnss6hHKJUTP8) | N/A |
| Week 3 | [172 mg, 43% RDA](https://photos.app.goo.gl/gbhBp9VYrUWqFVs79) | 141 / 86, 59 |

Overall workout volume has increased dramatically in the last month or two (since the new year and picking up BJJ again).  Average intensity and volume have increased significantly, regarding effects on RHR

No abservable effect, but after follow up with RN, intake is not high enough from food alone to effect blood pressure.  Needs to be about 400mg agove RDA (e.g. supplement) ([reference](https://www.livescience.com/55355-magnesium-blood-pressure.html)); that's about 800 mg total / day (400 RDA + 400 supplement).  I was averaging (from food intake alone) only 270 mg / day.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

**Take Two:**

Magnesium supplements are easy to find ([Amazon Link](), or any pharmacy), but note that Magnesium Citrate has a much better absorbtion rate that Magnesium Oxide.

Dosage:  2 x 250 mg servings / day (this is a little high, but my daily food intake is a little below the RDA (400 mg); so I'd still average about 750 mg / day).  *Start 2/19/19.*

| Date    | Blood Pressure | RHR |
| ------- |:--------------:|:---:|
| [2/12/19](https://photos.app.goo.gl/5VpNmRpyWyHULXdS6) | 141 / 86       | 59  |
| 2/26/19 | 132 / 78       | 63  |
| [3/29/19](https://photos.app.goo.gl/soTdGqZTuuat4Tow5) | 139 / 78       | 69  |

**Result:**  Virtually none

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

**Take Three:**

Taking things one step further to see if there's a difference between types of magnesium supplement.  Previously used magnesium citrate gel cap, switching to magnesium-BHB powder.  The powder also has 722 mg magnesium versus 500 I was consuming in gel caps.  That on top of dietary intake may be too much, so I'll have to keep an eye out for side effects -- though this does afford more dietary flexability; and with my current training demands (7 hours of BJJ + 2 hours movement / active recovery and easy drilling).

Also reducing caffeine:

- Previous 3 Cups / Day = 300 -400 mg
- New 1 Cup + Tea = 180 - 280 mg

| Date    | Blood Pressure | RHR |
| ------- |:--------------:|:---:|
| 3/24/19 | 139 / 78       | 69  |
| 4/22/19 |                |     |
| 5/20/19 |                |     |

*other factors:*

- potential sleep / recovery study

Overall Progress: Cardio / Activity Level + Magnesium + Less Caffeine

| Date    | Blood Pressure | RHR |
| ------- |:--------------:|:---:|
| 1/15/19 | 144 / 88       | 77  |
| 2/12/19 | 141 / 86       | 59  |
| 2/26/19 | 132 / 78       | 63  |
| 3/24/19 | 139 / 78       | 69  |

*notes on supplementation:*

  - would rather get minerals (electroyltes and vitamins) from raw sources (i.e. whole food) and try to avoid supplementation if possible; trying to avoid medications (prescribed or OTC)
  - not trying to loose more weight or suppress appetite, but I'm following up on effects of electrolyte (specifically magnesium) intake on blood pressure since mine is still a bit high.
  - a large benefit of supplementation (protein powder is a good example of this) is the convenience factor... you're paying for the convenience of dropping a scoop of power in a liquid and mixing it up rather than cooking, preparing, and cleaning a whole meal.
  - supplementation is (arguably) required at some point as well.  Depending on your age and / or how intensely you train, it's really REALLY hard to even get enough calories, let alone keep your macros in check, make sure you're getting adequate vitamin intake, and you're fueling your recovery with enough electrolytes and sleep; all while not spending most of your day in the kitchen.
  - So, my main interests in BHB supplementation is:  quick recovery between workouts (for when there are 2 / day), to add electorytes (without sugary sports drinks or artificial sweeteners), and examine effects of electorlyte intake on blood pressure.  Also, may help get back on track quicker from social / indulgent meals without sacrificing nutritional value (vitamin / mineral density).
  - If it helps supress my appetite a bit and holds me over to the next meal time, or time I'm near the kitchen (rather than having to splurge on convenience foods), that's an added bonus.
  - the down side is that BHB supplements can be fairly expensive, so I'm not sure about the intake or effective dosage levels, etc... I'm not super thrilled about the high sodium intake either so it might be relegated to expcetionally hard training days.  Raw ketone's don't have this, but they are not widely commercially available and VERY expensive ($15 / ounce!).
