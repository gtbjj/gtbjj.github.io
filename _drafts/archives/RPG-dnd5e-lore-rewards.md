> Tathmaht / Tiamat:"... was the second being to exist in Creation.  The counterart of Anu, its creation and death lead to the birth of hellish outer domains.  Anu was the first being in Creation and sought a state of toal purity and cast all evil from itself.  However, these elements coalesced into a single being:  Tathamet, a seven-headed dragon that was the sum total of all evil.  Though seaparate entities, Anu and Tathamet were bound within the Pear that contained them.  There they warred against each other in an unedning battle for ages uncounted.  Tathamet, along with Anu, died in the final battle they had against each other.  Tathamet's blackened, smoldering husk spiraled into the lower darkness of reality.  From his putrid flesh arose the evil outer realms and the races that arose from them.  Allegedly his three strongest maws gave birth to three greater evils while the four lesser birthed lesser ones.

> The Entorpy Tide (needs work):  Ship of great power must always come at a great cost.  Though clearly heralding a necrotic energy from the seas, the exact origins of the ship are unknown.  However, Digoria is not the first captian, nor Ellion Stryfe.  Stryfe has suggested that Digoria's mother (assumed dead) was once captain of the ship.  Failing to uphold the bargain one strikes to gain captainhood of the ship results in becoming one of the mindless undead crew for all eternity.

> **Cosmology (part ?):  Pandemonium - "location of the sin war, 'scar' of separation between Anu and Tiamat"

> **The Entropy Tide (part II):**  The ship's name suggests, when the tide breaks, after radnomness has reached critical mass, chaos is loosed on the world.
