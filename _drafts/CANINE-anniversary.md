A Timeline:  process notes:
- Adoption:  2 years old, potty trainied, doesn't know to sit:  dropped off at 87 lbs (about 15 overweight), fleas, HW+, GI Worm +, "jumping 6' fences"
- 2017-DEC
  - RIGHT - did my homework (as much as i could) on breeds and what I "thoughtt" I wanted in a dog, lifestyle hobby / working, etc...
  - how to get in truck?
  - RIGHT - low expectations initally (where to pee, and "no" / redirect (i.e. chewing))
  - RIGHT - regular training routine / learning to learn; work for (nearly) all food
- 2018-JAN
  - RIGHT - detective work - the dog doesn't make mistakes, everything is learned
  - RIGHT - understand people want different things from their dogs
  - medical leave for 2 months, "no activity"
- 2018-FEB
  - WRONG - temperment / ego after some success, glad I got the dog I did (softer) than the one I wanted (harder) -- more forgiving to my incompetence as a trainer / handler
- 2018-MAR
  - Building up and getting good attentive heeling
  - plateau and and re-entry of ego / expectations
- 2018-APR
  - highest motivation in morning after resting all night
  - experimented with combining sessions w/ rests into one long session for convenience of set up
- 2018-MAY
  - WRONG - listen to your dog / weather; long sessions too difficult in summer heat
  - WRONG - weather / my own temper effected by weather; certainly dog's too
- 2018-JUN
  - WRONG - bite accident; sound environmentals, shitty impulse control / focus on me
  - WRONG - getting more environmentally stable, but forgot about impulse control / (over)stimulation; this is about when I started doing OB in various stimulation levels (hardware stores, pet stores, etc) under strict control rather than "just going to a place and expecting things to take care of themselves..."
  - tooth injury - no biting / tugging
2018-JUL
  - more frequent / copious rewards - don't be so stingy, make it worth working for
  - "just play" sometimes
2018-AUG
  - rainy days are great of playing with new concepts / ideas / tricks or just resting
  - double food on whole crag days
  - have a different daily focus to keep training fun (it is fun, but difficult to establish consistency / progress)
- 2018-OCT
  - dog lovers suck and so do big box stores (social media of canine world)
  - some people (children) amaze me, some adults are idiots (3 near misses, park, crag, pet store)
  - experimenting with crating for 15 min before training sessions (to build anticipation) -- see below link on reward systems article (e.g. anticipation vs. reciept of reward)
- 2018-NOV
  - no crate before training, but play instead to build drive
  - move to ~3 weekly focuses and work them every day (versus daily activity / drill)
  - first ecollar (dogtra 200c), very good for trash, and strays in back yard at night
  - 4 x 5 min sessions is very very effective (considerations for set up though, see below)
  - picking 3 things to focus feels very fun an effective - can always push to another week if needed, enough variance to keep things fun day-to-day; day-to-day change in focus seemed to hard to "build momentum"



Basic Prinicples and Scheduling:
- it MUST be fun, for you and the dog
- be prepared for change (weather, experience, injury, sicknes, goals, etc..)
- basic ob:  1 - 3 min x 10 / day (Ed Frawley), or 5 x 5 min (tarheel)
- even SCH OB = 5-7 min 2x / day "will get you there" ([link](http://www.myschutzhundlife.com/single-post/2017/02/13/Finding-Time-to-Train))
- even pro athletes take days off, so does your dog ([video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kLA1TaByJbc)), let them be a dog, go for a walk or hike, "just play"
- shorter, more frequent session REALLY DO work better, but sometimes "assembly is required" (e.g. tracking, jumps, etc...); some time offset by picking weekly focus
- have goals:  long term (years / titles), medium term (monthly), short term (weekly goals / focus)
- never stop learning
