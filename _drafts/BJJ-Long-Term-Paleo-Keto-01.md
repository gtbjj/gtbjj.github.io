#### Overall Recap

Problems
- social
- lots of time in the kitche (due to training routine)

Perks:
- weight is very easy to manage w/o feeling depleted, moody, or deprived
  - I'm comfortably within my BJJ weight class (167.5 lbs w/ Gi) and even a little light; after all climbing is a battle against gravity!
- still nutritionally sound (see previous post)
- no identified negative impact on performance (have not tested long crag day yet, but so far so good for BJJ and Bouldering)

#### Budget

  - BUDGET:  "eating healthy is expensive" is an oft touted excuse.  Medical bills are also expensive.  Missing work for illness is also expensive (and a lot less fun).  Eating helathy takes time and effort, as does anything worthwhile.  That said, I weigh about 160-165 lbs, do outdoor rock climbing 1-2x per week and Brazilian Jiu Jitsu 4-5x per week.  To fuel that I spend about $250 per month on food (including protein powder, but excluding social events).  Before anyone flies off the handle, realize that that's a little over $8 / day for exclusively grass fed / free range animal products and organic or atleast [clean 15]() vegetables that are all [paleo friendly]() and conducive to [ketosis]().  You can barely get a "value meal" at a fast food chain for $8 anymore and that's only a single meal... hell, a cup of coffee, two pieces of sausage, and 3 eggs cost me $8 at Waffle House the other day, and the butter wasn't even real!  On top of that, what are some other things you spend $8 / day on?  Do you really need cable or an unlimited data plan, or three tv / music subscriptions?  Taken another way, say you've been getting by on $5 / day worth of Ramen Noodles and Fast Food Dollar Menu items.  By saving $3 / day elsewhere (i.e. ditching Starbucks and soda for good, one less round at the bar, etc...) you'll be doing wonders for your body and sport performance.
