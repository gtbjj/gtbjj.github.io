* Week 1: Sun - Wed
* Week 2: +/- 15 all days
* Week 3:

*Followers:  Most Active Times:*

* Week 1: 12p > 3p > 9a > 6p
* Week 2: 12p > 3p > 9a > 6p

**Content Strategy Test:**

* Post 4x / day (9/12/3/6) + inconsistent stories
    * +22% reach, +53% engagement
* Post 5x / day (9/11/1/3/6) + daily story + inconsistent live
    * +14% reach, +34% engagement, -1% followers
* motivation/meme (11aSched),  + vid/reel/carousel (2pMan) + 3 lives / TVs per week
    * -1.4% reach, -39% engagement, -0.4% followers
    * TOTAL reach went down, but of 15 posts, 6 were flagged as "doing better than 85% of other posts"
    * So, I have a good bead on "quality", but posting more yields more TOTAL engagement, but not necessarily per post

**Consider Scheduled Post Types:**
* carousels
	* Attention = why should I care (first slide)
	* Interest = capture & give more (6 slides)
	* Desire = details (2 slides, juicy / punch line, educate / entertain)
	* Action = step-by-step instructions (one slide)
* tag a friend
* like vs comment
* giveaway

 ### Jobs To Be Done Framework

**Step 1:** 

* Why do people *hire* my product / service?
    * My Guesses:
        * Loose weight > build confidence / capability / health
        * improve performance / strength (small percentage, level 2 &3)
   * Public Responses:
* Why do people *fire* my product / service?
    * My Guesses:
        * ineffective service
        * ineffective relationship (more likely)
        * too expensive
        * inconvenient
        * lack of commitment
    * Public Responses:
* How are people *struggling* with my product or service?
    * My Guesses:
        * too complicated
        * ineffective
        * expensive
       * outcome / not relationship based
    * Public Repsonses:
* Where are my *opportunities* to improve my product or service?

**Step 2:**

* Who *expressed interest, but didn't buy* my product / service?
* Who *did buy* my product / service?
* Who *bought and actively uses* my prodcut / service?
* Who *bought and are not* actively using my product / service?
* Who *bought, but later returned* my product / service?

**Step 3:**  Interview each of the groups from Step 2

* Understand the point of sale:
    * When did you buy the prodcut?
    * Where were you?
    * What time of day as it?
    * Was anyone else with you at the time?
    * How did you buy the product?
* Find their first thougth about the purchase:
    * When did you fisrt start looking for seomthign to solve your problem(s)?
    * Where were you?
    * Were you with someoen?  What did they say?
    * What triggered you to think about this?
* What else did they consider:
    * Tell me about how you looked for a product to solve your problem.
    * What kinds of solutions did you truy?  Or not try?  Why or why not?
* Uncover the emotions assocaited with teh purchase:
    * What was the conversation like when you talked about buying the product with your spouse / friend / parents?
    * Before you bought, did you imagine what life would be like with the product?  Where were you when you were thinking this?
    * Did you have any anxiety about buying?  Did you hear something about the product that made you nerous? What was it? Why did it make you nervous?

**Step 4:**  The timeline

| passive looking | active looking | deciding    | consuming y/n |
| first thoguht       | event one         | event two | buy now             |

**Step 5:** The forces

* Progress-Making: Existing Bx > push of the situation> pull of the new idea > New Bx
* Progress-Hindering: New Bx > anxiety of new solution > allegiance to current Bx > existing Bx

**Step 6:**

* What nudged people to make their decision?
* Who did they see as "the competition?"
* Which anxietyties did they have to overcome to purchase?
* How did what they *thoguht* they were buying match up to what they *actually* got?

**Step 7:**

* How can I talk about my business in a way that resonates more with *how my customers talk about their needs*, challenges, and concerns?
* How can I reach out to people in places I've never considered before?
* How can I see my customers' trajectory and anticipate where they're heading?


#### Envision and Re-Imagine

Purpose / function:  sell my own business OR build referrals?

* building my own takes more work, yields more income
* referrals mean branding is already done, "just sell yourself" as "evidence"
* Books:  nobody wanted to read, just be told what to do
* Ads:  nobody cares, they want to see me choke folks and train dogs
* Science:  see ads
* Podcast:  see ads, but I get a lot of personal value from the conversations as well
* PN:  need to decide in 30 days, kind of falling off the wagon with other opportunities
    * I put lots of irons in the fire and stoke the flame, can't keep them all going, so pick the hottest
* Dreamline 6mo (stable enough, yes) 12 mo (stable enough, NO!)
