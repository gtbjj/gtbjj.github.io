#### Social Activity

- this is probably only (and biggest) hang up
- my previous research indicates every other aspect to be a success
- we all (should) know that longevity is key with any way of eating, and therefore "sensible indulgences" ([here](https://www.marksdailyapple.com/sensible-vices/) and [here](https://www.marksdailyapple.com/sensible-vices-round-2/)), and even [some unsensible ones](https://robbwolf.com/2012/02/02/8204/), are required to maintain good social, emotional, and mental health as well as physical health.  "Life is too short to never eat ice cream again."
- There are ways to mitigate the damages of indulgences (e.g. still paleo, or burger w/o the bun), but it's also nice to go out with friends, have a few drinks, and not worry about that
- the trouble is that with a ketogenic diet, your whipping yourself out of ketosis which is the fundamental operant principle.  you can't just "get right back on track the next day" (see bleow as to why).


So, here is where my process went:

  - weekly carb limit?  Don't want to track / count things forever
  - CKD:  1 free meal / week (for social longevity), doesn't / won't necessarily be total junk (e.g. if eating out:  sweet potato fries, 1 C ice cream, 2 beers = ~120g carbs).  On top of your regular day's 30g-50g you're still fairly close to the suggested 150g limit on carb-load days[reference](https://www.kissmyketo.com/blogs/weight-loss-obesity/cyclical-ketogenic-diet-better-than-regular)
    - OPTION 1:  [Intermitent Fasting](https://perfectketo.com/cheating-on-keto/):  ... is raved about, but IMO fasting or any type of "overcompensation" after a cheat meal increases the likelihood that you'll break and cheat agaain... so, that option is off the table for me.
    - OPTION 2:  Getting back on Track:  This avoids the potential opposition reflex to the overcompensation of Option 1 and is generally sound advice for long term adherents in my opinion.  The trouble is that depending on how overboard you went, mathematically (not acocunting for genetics, hormones, or activity levels) it might take 2 weeks or so to bring your average daily carb intake back down to ketogenic levels.  This isn't a problem if you've already reached your weight goals, but early on you'd end up just spinning your wheels or even going in reverse.  However, the longer you've been in ketosis and the more modest your indulgence (e.g. the example foods above vs. an all day bender), the quicker you'll be able to recover from it without adverse means.
    - OPTION 3:  Ultra Low Carb (~10g):  Here we eat about the same amount of calories as a typical day (Option 2), but dramatically reduce our carb intake (Option 1) to speed up the process of Option 2 without the potentially adverse effects of Option 1.  In general I have sitauted myself arond 30-50g of carbs per day because I have documented data that otherwise I'm severely lacking in some vitamins and minerasl (link to previous posts).  Howeer, as a temporary / short term resolution the ill effects may be marginal (i.e. If I'm eating 27 nutrient dense meals throughout the week, 1 indulgent meal isn't going to plument me into a deficiency... that wasn't already there anyway).
    - IN PRACTICE:  OPTION 3:
      - 2/2 - 2/3:  avg. net carbs prior 50g (9-11%): cheat load  300g:  intentionally way overboard (2 cheat meals) to exaggerate the point, a single *mindful* meal would never be this much.  Mathematically 13 days (2 weeks) at 30g / day would bring me back to ketosis -- that doesn't include 
      - breakfast (6:00 am):  Coffee + 1 scoop whey + 3 TB coconut oil
      - 2nd breakfast (9:00 am):  Coffee + 1 scoop whey + 3 TB coconut oil
      - lunch (12:00 pm):  Coffee + 1 scoop whey + 3 TB coconut oil
      - dinner (3:00 pm):  regular keto meal
      - 2nd dinner (6:30 pm):  regular keto meal
      - "Detox Day" Macros:  69F / 27P / 4C [screenshot](https://photos.google.com/share/AF1QipM5v4eV-rHEZru8w_xFnS44Ey4s8_Sk8JPxyshgJr0ulaHdmfe1yw9HtWCWbvegxw?key=cDlZaXpXcTdXODhLc2tGU0ttUW9XQzRUTHl3dXlR)
      - Weekly Follow Up:  As expected, it took about a week or so to get back into ketosis.  Admitedly, I ran out of urinalysis strips so I wasn't testing every day.  However, by Saturday I did have a small amount of ketones in my urine and my macros had leveled out to normal ketogenic levels ([70F / 24P / 6C](https://photos.app.goo.gl/CtbSnrAqg49bRsS2A))
      *Normally I have 3 Cups Coffee / day anyway, one black, one with 1 scoop  of whey + 2 TB butter, and another with 2 scoops whey and 3 TB coconut oil
    - OPTION 4:  Drugs:  There are lots of exogenous ketone salt products on the market (both powders and pills).  My natural instinct is to stay away from this because as I've said before, I want my food to be my "medicine" and not rely on pharmaceuticals, be they prescribed or over the counter, for my health.  At any rate, ketone salts are still not cheap, especially if you're taking them every day.  So, I a modest intake on the day after an indulgence may help (as the products are intended) to promote a getting your body back into a ketogenic state by adding ketones from an external source rather than waiting for your body to create them after your glycogen stores have been depleted.
    - OPTION 4 IN PRACTICE:
      - Cheat Meal / Day Macros:  3017 Cal @ 9F / 11P / 30C
      - "Detox Day" Macros:  2253 Cal @ 74F / 21P / 5C
      - This was actually almost as "low carb" as OPTION 3, but with more fat and the benefit of exogenous ketones (rather than just generally higher fat intake))
      - The product I used was [BPI Keto Weight Loss](https://www.amazon.com/Keto-Weight-Loss-Ketogenic-Burner/dp/B01NAGJ45R/ref=sr_1_3_a_it?ie=UTF8&qid=1550325625&sr=8-3&keywords=bpi+ketone+capsules), which I selected merely because it was readily available at Walgreens / Kroger's.  There are better products out there, such as [Perfect Keto Exogenous Ketones BHB](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07C671SQL/?coliid=I2HK72OZLDEEXW&colid=29TQFJIH9OSGB&psc=0&ref_=lv_ov_lig_dp_it) that do not contain caffiene and have MCT oil (about 6x more concentrated than raw coconut oil).  Knowing the product I used contained caffiene, I simply skipped one cup of coffee that day.  I didn't experience any side effects other than the supplements are (by design) VERY salty, not in taste, but I felt very thirsty for the rest of the day afterwards.

#### More Thoughts on "Cheating:"

The long / short is that it depends on:

- how overboard you went
  - Did you eat one cup of ice cream, or a pint (then go out for pizza... and beer, then get fast food on the way home?)
- how long you were in ketosis prior
  - if you were barely starting out, your may have not even fully gotten into ketosis before "cheating"; thereby slowing your progress.  if you've been at this for a few months or years, you will probably rebound much faster or your body will at least let you know you screwed up, and in a hurry (think diahhrea, cramps, bloating, headaches, acne, etc...)
- and how active / low carb you are after
  - you just dropped a sugar bomb (and probably starch and sodium bombs too), all those thing bind up you GI and soak up water like cellular sponges.  So, you need to get rid of them... again.


Haven't met your goal / have a competition coming up?

- you shouldn't be cheating IMO.  Save it for a victory meal.

Met your goal?  What happens when you cheat:

- once per week? (planned, but not special or rare)
  - in my case I gained about 8 - 10 lbs (160 to 168/170) with a cheat meal or two on Friday or Saturday, and it too more than a week to get back into ketosis.  For reference, I do BJJ 5-7 days per week and those "meals" were single sitting, non-buffet, normally proportioned meals (just delicious, sugary, junky ones)
- once per two weeks? (planned, rare, not special)
- once per month? (planned, special, too rare?)

- How long does it take to get (back) into ketosis:
  - google results:  2-10 days?
  - keto answers podcast - you may be doing more damamge in your cheat meal/day (for sure weekend) than you can heal your gut from in the coming week before you do it again
  - Personally:  ran 2 experiments (see calendar for details), < 4 days without supplmenets on current diet to get back to ketosis
  - that's 3 days "in the black" of healthy eating / living; not bad, but still less than 50% of the week
  - If we try to limit our planned indulgences (social or otherwise) to every-other-week, then were in ketosis 70% of the time (10 / 14 days).)
  - NOTE:  could still do 1 / week if more aggressive methods are used
