```"Play, like dreams, serves the function of self realization." ~ D.W. Winnicott```

```"Trauma occurs when there is an encounter with the Real, which denies signification." ~ Lacan```

Sahira's case is unique in that I encountered her long before I had any intention of writing (these essays).  Yet, it was a very specific and subtle mometn that occured to me as an intern therapist that remains a point of conversation to this day between the the (then) supervising therapist and myself many years later.

Sahira is five years old when she is enroleld in our Partial Hospitalization Program.  She is a particularly violent and volatile youngster.  Her small frame seethes with hatred and vile disdain for everyone oozed from her pores.  Her straight, dark hair often covers her yees as she perpetually looks downward.  So, to communicate you must play, and to play is to communicate.  I watch her draw endlessly obsencely violent scenes in sidewalk chalk.  I learn that her step-father had done nothing short of water-boarding her in teh bathtub -- a rather generaous term for hodling a child face up at the bottom of a bathtub under a running faucet.  Hence her removal from the home.

One day I'm observing goup (therapy) while the supervising therapist, who I still have a tremendous amount of respect for, facilaites semi-structured recreational time for the group of five to eight year olds.  I am writing notes to myself regarding Sahira's behavior.  With the utmost intent, she seeks out a toy dragon and a medium sized Barbie car.  Meticulously, and with great precision, she proceeds to break the wings and leggs off the dragon -- behavior one might be inclined to think points towards cociopathy.

Rather than berate the child for having broken a toy, the therapist tils her head, looks confused, and watches on.  Sahira proceeds to hold the wingless, legless dragon on top of the car and pus it around the room.  Playfully the therapist asks Sahira, "Why does a dragon need to ride in a car?"  Sahira, in typical fashion, looks up at the therapist in a scowl momenentarily, and without saying a word returns to her work wheeling the dragon around.

Perhaps I'm reading to omuch into the sitaution, or looking for confirmation for bleiefs I've already formed.  Nevertheless, I write a simple message in my notebook, tear it off, and pass it to the therapist as we clean the supplies and trasition the group to the next activity.  The note read, "Little fire breathing monsters need a car when tehy don't have legs to escape."

Years later that therapist becomes my manager as I applied for a employed position as a therapist.  Upon accepting the job offer I was granted, I found a note on my desk reminding me that that little message, a simple observation that could easily be overlooked even by a keen, seasoned therapist, had remaind on the aformentioned therapist's desk during the years that hve passed.

We all have blindspots, in our personal lives (which, rest assured spill into our clinical personas) or because by definition our focus can not both be equally precise and pervasieve simultaneiously.  No symbol is too small, particuarlly in the context of a child's play.  It wouldn't be until years later that I learned to turn such insights into a therapeutic force for the patient.  For Sahira, it was mostly an intellectual insight that served the treating clinicians.  But, giving sincere feedback that reflects a genuinely stricken response in ourselves covneys a reverberating message of being heard, or perhaps seen, in a way that is "therapeutic."
