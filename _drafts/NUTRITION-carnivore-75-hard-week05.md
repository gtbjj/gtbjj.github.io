5/17

* Alcohol screws up everything.  I "officially" celebrated my birthday yesterday with friends I haven't seen in too long (a much needed reprieve during lockdown times) -- and one of the pillars of the challenge is community.  Given the occasion, I extended my feeding window well beyond 8 hours and had a few too many drinks.  The result was horrible diarrhea several times throughout the night, of course I slept like crap, the diarrhea persisted throughout most of the next day, and my appetite and the next day's feeding window were thrown way off.  I didn't have the appetite to eat enough calories early in the day, so I had to break my fast after only 8 hours and eat again.  I'm not sure if or how I'll try to "make up the time", but my average fasted time still close to 19 hours so I'm considering myself still on track.
