```"It is a joy to be hiddend, and a disaster not to be found" ~ D.W. Winnicott```

```I hope you're proud of yourself for the times you've said 'yes' when all it meant was extra work for you and was seemingly helpful only to somebody else." ~ Mr. Rogers```

Abbi is 13.  Her mother has brought her to counseling after learning that Abbi had been sexually exploited by a predator who Abbi met online.  I routinely schedule the first appointment with Abbi and her mtoher at their home.  Not surprisingly, they insist on having a female therapist.  I am able to have a detailed and civil conversation wtih them lasting the entire therapy hour about (it's not as simple or obvious as it seems) why this preference is important to them, and what factors into an effective (and hopefully restorative!) therapeutic relationship.

At the end of the frist meeting I negotiate to return next week to administer a trauma assessment and allow Abbi and her mother to discuss if they want to continue to work with me further.  I call my supervisor after leaving, searching for affirmation that I'd made an ethically sound decision.  My supervisor raises no objection to scheduling the trauma assessment, or the discussion that took place, but adamantly encourages me to refer the case to another agency that could provide a female clinician.

I don't like the dismissive, blase' tone in my supervisor's voice.  We hang up and I toss the phone onto my passenger seat.  Referring Abbi elsewhere didn't feel right.  This was a rural community and it might take a month or more to get other services in place.  I have a long drive tonight and plenty of time to think.

I show up the following week for the trauma assessment, score, and share the resutls with Abbi and her mother.  They identify that they'd like to schedule another session for Abbi and I to continue to work together.  I'm curious and speechlessly suprrised given that Abii's mother is as shrewd as she is teeming with feral anxiety.

In total I work with Abbi for about six months or longer, so I'm not able to exactly recall the timeframe of our discourse.  About midway through treatment I made a report (required by law) to Child Protecitve Serviecs -- though I don't recall the specific reason.  Enter the wrath of a mother scorned.

Abbi is moved immediatley and abruptly from school to a group home.  Immediately her mother phones me for help, of course, I am limited in what I can disclose.  Within a day or two her mother begins assailing me with a daily barrage of harassing voice messages ranging from threatening litigation to detailed descriptions of how my "treatment" is making her daughter worse.  There is no shortage of creative profanity either.

The calls continue into my "vacation" and I decide to make a return call to Abbi's mother.  To my own surprise I muster the gumption to cut her off and pointedly remind ehr that at this time I'm not legally required to speak to her (the mother) and probably would be advicsed against doing so.  "This call is a courtesy to you, because I'm trying to help your daguther."  That got her attention.  More unstable than her daughter?  Yes.  Still a mother who doesn't want to lose a child?  Also, yes.  I proceed in the following weeks by meeting with Abbi at her group home.

Around that time I bring up Abbi's case in group supervision.  My supervisor's only response was something to the effect of; "Oh, you're still seeing her?  I thought you'd referred them out."  Somehow, that was less than unhelpful.

By no small feat, and not wtihout setbacks, I am able to make some progress with Abbi.  It took a small miracle to get Abbi's mother and father in the same room together, let alone participate in aything resembling family "therapy."  I don't belive in coincidences, yet each of those things happened.

For several meetings Abbi's joy is able to shine through her unkempt hair.  Her mtoehr's parting phrase would be forever etched into my memory; "there's light at the end of our tunnel and osme of that is thanks to you."  I am relieved and exhausted.  It wasn't until much later that the weight of the mother's words strikes me.  The same voice that venomously and vehemently cursed, threatened, and harassed me only a few short months prior now thanked me.  Persistence has its benefits.  It also has a cost, with an unfavorable interest rate.

**Afterward:**

A lot of details got missed in the telling of this story.  There were layers and layers of "the ball being dropped" by DFCS and the legal system, a naive social worker unwittingly pitting me agianst an until-now-absent father who I was to "reunify" with the family, navigating the truly hateful and venomous relationship between the mother and father, a disconcerned supervisor, and an aloof psychologist managing a group home.

I would like to point out that the referenced supervisor here is a different person than the one mentioned in "It's You I Like."  This story is where I learned of anti-mentors.  Getting a bit ahead of myself here, years down the road, this same supervisor would refuse to sign any and all paperwork regarding my license due to "my great potential, but serious ethical concerns."  As it turned out, I responsed by sending an email to the founder and former CEO (who had "retired" to private practice) of that agency and she was delighted to compete the appropriate forms -- they were mailed within three days; weekend included.

Reflecting on this story again makes me admire my fortitude even early in my career to "do the right thing", or at least try my damnedest.  I have no doubt that the supervisor held a petty vendetta against me; what an irreverent slap in the face to defy your supervisor and have it turn out fantastic for the client.

In the closing comment I mention the "unfavorable interest rate" of persistence.  Did I do the "right" thing for the patient, I think so.  Did it cost me a trememndously uknown amount in terms of furthering my careers and licensure?  Unquestionably.  The "interst rate" for persistence is compound and the world is not always kind.  Unfortunately your merits and obligation to "do no harm" are of no interest to the personal politics and petty power struggles of a greedy world.

I once saw a motivational poster that said "you'll never regret doing the right thing."  That's bullshit.  Fortunately, my list of regrets in life is pretty short.  Almost all of them come from the unforseen consequences of "doing the right thing."  Would I make the same decision(s) again with Abbi?  Of course.  Why?  Becasue agregiously unethical "practitioners" like this supervisor don't get to "win."  My life and my practice will continue to be my protest against them.  The personal is, after all, the political.
