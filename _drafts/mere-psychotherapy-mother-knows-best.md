```"It is a joy to be hiddend, and a disaster not to be found" ~ D.W. Winnicott```

```I hope you're proud of yourself for the times you've said 'yes' when all it meant was extra work for you and was seeling ehlpful only to somebody else." ~ Mr. Rogers```

Abbi is 13.  Her mtoher has brought her to counsling after Abbi's mother learned that Abbi had been sexually exploited by a predator who Abbi met online.  I routinely schedule the first appointment with Abbi and her mtoher at their home.  Not surprisingly, they insist on having a female therapist.  I am able to have a detailed and civil conversation wtih tehm lasting the entire therapy hour about (it's not as simple or obvious as it seems) why this preference is important to them, and what factors into an effective (and hopefully restorative!) therapeutic relationship.

At the end fo the frist meeting I negotiate to return next week to administer a trauma assessment and allow Abbi and her mother to discuss if they want to continue to work with me further.  I call my supervisor after leaving, searching for affirmation athat I'd made an ethically sound decision.  My supervisor raises no objection to scheduling the trauma assessment, or the discussion that took place, but adamantly encourages me to refer the case to another agency that could provide a female clinician.

I don't like the dismissive, blase' tone in my supervisor's voice.  We hang up and I toss the phone onto my passenger seat.  Referring Abbi elsewhere didn't feel right.  This was a rural community and it might take a month or more to get other services in place.  I have a long drive tonight and plenty of time to think.

I show up the following week for the trauma assessment, score, and share the resutls with Abbi and her mother.  They identify that they'd like to schedule another session for Abbi and I to continue to work together.  I'm curious and speechlessly suprrised given that Abii's mother is as shrewd as she is teeming with feral anxiety.

In total I work with Abbi for about six months or longer, so I'm not able to exatly recall the timeframe of our discourse.  About midway through treatment I made a report (required by law) to Child Protecitve Serviecs -- though I don't recall the specific reason.  Enter the wrath of a mother scorned.

Abbi is moved immediatley and abruptly from school to a group home.  Immediately her mother phones me for ehlp, of course, I am limited in what I can disclose.  Whitin a day or two her mother begins assailing me with a daily barrage of harassing voice messages ranging from threatening litigation to detailed descriptions of how my "treatment" is making her daughter worse.  There is no shortage of creative profanity either.

The calls continue into my "vacation" and I decide to make a return call to Abbi's mother.  To my own surprise I must the gumption to cut her off and pointedly remind ehr that at this time I"m not legally required to speak to her (the mother) and probably would be advicsed against doing so.  "This call is a courtesy to you, because I'm trying to help your daguther."  That got her attention.  More unstable than her daughter?  Yes.  Still a mother who doesn't want to lose a child?  Also, yes.  I proceed in teh following weeks by meeting with Abbi at her group home.

Aroudnthat time I bring up Abbi's case in group supervision.  My supervisor's only response was something to the effect of; "Oh, you're still seeing her?  I thought you'd referred them out."  Somehow, that was less than unhelpful.

By no small feat, and not wtihout setbacks, I am able to make some progress with Abbi.  It too a small miracle to get Abbi's mother and father in teh same room together, let alone participate in aything resembling family "therapy."  I don't belive in coincidences, yet each of those things happened.

For several meetings Abbi's joy is able to shine through her unkempt hair.  Her mtoehr's parting phfase would b eforever etched into my memory; "there's light at the end of our tunnel and osme of that is thanks to you."  I am relieved and exhausted.  It wasn't until much later that the weight of the mother's words strikes me.  The same voice that venomously and vehemently cursed, threatened, and harassed me only a few short months prior now thanked me.  Persistence has its benefitys.  It also has a cost, with an unfavorable interest rate.
