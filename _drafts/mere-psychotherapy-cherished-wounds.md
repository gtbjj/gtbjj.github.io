For a brief period in my career I worked as a school-based therapist.  Meaning, I was employed by a community mental health agency and contractually housed (had an office) in a school in one of our areas of service.  Through a substantial state grand and collaborative efforts from both the school system and the agnecy, I had worked with both school and clinical systems to build an elaborate play therapy room conjoined to my office.  Effectively, this was a single full-sized school classroom that had been partitioned into the two parts.

Franz is enrolled in teh second grade when I meet him.  His mother meets me after school one day to request an assessment consultation after being referred by Franz's teacher.  During the assessment Franz's mother describes autism-like symptoms in conjunction with increased anxiety.  I proceed, as was common, to conduct a trauma assessment (THQ) as Franz's anxiety and catatonia are quite notable and an anomaly considering the reported healthy and appropriate family dynamics between Franz and his mother / father and between his mother and father.  There has been no reported incident of neglect or abuse.  Spankings are extremely rare in the household.

For our first session, I go to Franz's classroom to bring him back to my office.  It is early in the morning and other students are still getting settled in the classroom.  Franz stiffens his body and freezes in his chair.  After extensive persuasive efforts from the teacher and her aide, they leave Franz to me and go about tending to the rest of the class.  Franz begins to cry softly while still rigidly stuck to his chair and an avoidant fixed gaze in front of him.

Later, I collaborate with the teacher and we conclude that since my office is between Franz's classroom and the cafeteria, the teacher would escort her class past my office after lunch so that I can "intercept" Franz or at least have the opportunity for a more smooth transition.  All goes according to plan, until the planning comes to an end.

Once inside my office, Franz stands silently, frozen in terror.  My common reponse to this, especially give the facility and resources available, is to present a few varied play materials in front of the child (for example:  crayons and paper, a beanbag chair, action figures) and proceed to "mill around" or appear to be disinterested in teh child while working at my desk or writing on teh whiteboard; allowing the child to proceed at their own pace whtiout the pressure of direct observation (i.e. expectation to engage).

To my frustration, this is of no avail.  Several sessions pass in this manner.  However, I have managed to "steer" Franz a little further into the room and he eventually sits down on the bare floor -- though certainly in any way but relaxed.  I decide to hedge my bests.  I leave an assortment of supplies in front of Franz and leave the room.  As with most classrooms, there is a narrow window in the door which allows me to peer in intermittently to make sure there aren't any safety concerns.  Incidentally, Franz's teacher happens to walk by at that moment and remarks that I "have the patience of Job."

Through the window I see that Franz is writing on the paper I provided and after he had finished I re-enter the room.  It is my intention to end the session here, but my cruiosity gets the best of me and I probed about Franz's drawing.  Of course, the barrage of questions was over-stimulating and my own frustration grows and my clinical tact is traded for stubbornness.

I want to "get to the bottom of this" and figure out what was the reason for Franz's behavior.  I begin reviewing the questions from the trauma assessment out loud, inquiring whether anyone has hurt Franz on purpose or if anyone has touched his private parts when he didn't want them to.  Through a series of question it is disclosed that a school teacher has (allegedly) touched Franz's crotch.  I thank Franz for working hard on his drawing and walked him back to his classroom.

Franz, however, is only the beginning of this story.  Every day in the practice of psychotherapy is rife with layer upon layer of ethical dilemmas.  Given the nature of the reported incident I immediatley seek consultation with teh school counselor, social worker, and principal as the school has their own internal reporting process in addition to my legal mandate to report the disclosed abuse.

The school officials and myself make our reports.  Within one week I am contacted by the supervisor at my agency.  She informs me that effective today, I'm no longer allowed on school property as the principal has contacted my supervisor with concerns about "the efficacy of my interventions and overall ethical principles."  Resistance is futile.  There is no revoking the decision.  My eployer has sided with their stakeholder and immediately and indefinitely stripped my of my caseload and suspends me without pay.

Where to go from here?  I beg and plead to even be allowed to return to the school to retrieve my personal posessions from my office.  What kind of decision making process is this?  What is going to happen to the other patients I was seeing?  What are they and their families being told about the sudden cessation of treatment?  Nevermind, how this process is going to effect the children themselves.  The only answer I get from my supervisor is that the principal felt my questioning "was both leading and inapproripate to be asking an eight year old."

I protest that the questions were identical to the ones I have asked on dozens of other trauma assessments with similarly aged children, some which I was specifically contracted by the agency to admisiter the assessment given my experience in the subject area.  The questions were also identical to the onese I had asked on admission when Franz's mother was present.

I am allowed to return to the school to retrieve my belongings, but not to work.  As I am packing up my office, Franz's teacher stops by and asks what's going on?  Why am I packing up my things?  I briefly state that the principal has decided that I acted unprofessionally with Franz and that I have been asked not to return to the school.  The teacher is shocked and apalled.  She assures me that "if I ever need a refernece, to contact her immediately."

I never speak to anyone from teh school again; not the teacher, not the social worker, not the school counselor, not the principal, none of the patients, none of their parents.  My agnecy offers to "allow" me to return to community-based rather than school-based work.  I decline and leave the agency.

In retrospect, I don't think any sexual misconduct has taken place with Franz.  Perhaps my questions were leading and he anticipated the "right" answers as a quick exit to alleviate the anxiety of our interaction.  Neverthless, passion can be fatal.  We have far more to contend with in this profession than our clinical execution alone.  We live in a world of insurance companies, reimbursement, diagnostic codes, hospitals, pharmaceuticals, agencies, and private practices alike.  They all have their agendas and allegiances whcih inevitably become known one way or another.

On the door to my office at the school hangs a small whiteboard that I write a "thought of the day" on every day.  As I pack up my things to leave I notice that I haven't changed the quotes since the last day I saw Franz.  It read:

```"Analytic interpretation isn't for understanding, it's for making waves" ~ Lacan```

```"Some people feel the rain, others just get wet." ~ Bob Marley```

**Afterward:**

To this day, this is one of the most powerful and revealing experinces of my career.
