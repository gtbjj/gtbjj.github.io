prime the engine vs. squeeze the sponge

the second article makes sense and seems congruent with my minor xp with IF in the past:  for short bouts of excersise or daily functioning, it is fine.  But, for higher volumes / intensity of training it has a negative impact on performance.

For Example:

- your regular morning jog / walk around the block probably isn't negatively affected by whether you ate breakfast or not.  in another scenario, your "run of the mill" or routine gym climbing or bjj class might not see a dip in performance either.
- in contrast:  heading in to a two hour sparring session (note the increase in BOTH intensity and volume), or aiming to put down 10+ pitches in a day, or about to run a half/marathon, you will probably want some fuel in the tank before you even start... in fact, probably more than just "topped off" and a little in reserve.  stopping mid session in either of those scenarios to re-fuel would be less than ideal.

#### In Practice:  What I Learned

- confirmed above:
  - okay for "daily" training (no negative impacts noted)
  - metabolically I feel a little better "having something in the tank" first thing in the morning when I train to keep my metabolism rolling and start recovering even before I start training (also, not as hungry afterwords -- which buys time to not make impulsive decisions)
