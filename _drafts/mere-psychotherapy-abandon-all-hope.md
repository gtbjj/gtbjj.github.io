What do you say to a fifteen year old who has made four legitimate suicide attempts in teh last five mounts?  I have no idea, bu this is waht I ponder as I pull into the dirveway to meet Elliot.  Elliot is far from the first suicidal or traumatized patient I've worked with.  What felt different to me was that the "stakes" were highere.  There was not safety net of a hospital or clinc setting.  This was outpatient, in-home therapy.  I have a supervisor., but was seeing Elliot twice per week and was the "first responder" for all intents and purposes.

Elliot looks like an active, healthy, fifteen year old girl, donning sweatpands and an oversized t-shirt, sitting sheepishly sunken into the couch as I collect clinical history form her father.  Elliot is actively suicidal, has been cutting herself daily, and purging at least once per week.  Within the first week of treatment she makes another suicide attempt and is hospitalized.  There is nothign and no one to hide behind here.  These are dangerous and sacred waters to tread in.

I know that Elliot's mother and father have gone through a particularly difficult divorce and that both parties have witheld details as to why from Elliot for five years and counting, yet each the motehr and father inform me of these things in our first meetings respectively.  Early on in treatment, while talking to Elliot and her mother, her mtoher succumbs to her own overwhelming emotions and goes on to describe (in fairly vivid detail) Elliot's father's sex addiction and prolific masturbation including while in bed with Elliot (as a small child) and / or her other siblings.  She continues to describe the heinous confessions she found in her then husband's journal.  One gross over-disclosure after another.  There are some things chidren shouldn't have to know about.

For weeks Elliot remains heavy in my thoughts, such that my work with her becomes a topic in my own therapy.  Being exponentially more skilled and expereinced than myself, my therapist reminds me of the dmaging effects on one's ego development when they're prematurely exposed to adult sexuality.  Then, rather pointedly, my therapist reminds me that I cannot "save" Elliot.

Later, after one excetionally burdensome session I was leaving Elliot's home and stopped momentarily, looking at my reflection in the window of my truck.  I said to myself, maybe even out loud; "she is going to die... and I can't stop it."  My mind stays quiet for the next few seconds as I open the door and get in.  I close the door and look up at the rearview mirror; the next thougth to emerge; "that won't keep me from trying."

As is common with "borderline" types of personalities, progress and regression vacillate as turbulently as the patient's mood.  Some days Elliot seems alarmingly chipper and relatively "stable."  Other times, the world is ending; sometimes literally and by force.  There is no shortage of "grist" for the therapeutic mill here.

Elliot is rather intelligent and insightful.  One session we alk to the back porch and as we past a reclining lawn chair she asks, "What are we going to talk about today?"  Sarcastically I motioned to the reclining chair and said, "Well, you could lay on the couch and tell me about your dreams."  Much to my surprise she proceeds to do just that.  I'd be remiss if I didn't caution someone about the weight which our words carry with our patients.

Elliot's parents are inept.  They are caught up in an adolescent feud and don't seem capable or willing to get enough of a handle on their own psychosexual issues to preserve theri daughter's life -- evidenced by one slanderingn secret reveal at a time.

In one of my last sessions with Elliot, I have to inform her (I have already told the mother) that the agency I work for is closing and I will no longer be able to see her.  Elliot's verbalized disappointment wasn't a conving act as her presence is otherwise devoid of emotion.  If anything, she seemed strangely optimistic in the last few sessions.  Ultimately I make a referral to a colleague of mine in the area who I think will work well with Elliot.

I have never heard from Elliot, her parents, or the referred colleague since then.  I haven't attempted to follow up either.  Though, I won't lie, I've been tempted to search Google for both high school graduation rosters and obituaries equally.  As privileged as therapists are to the secrets and inner workings of other human beings, there are so many things we don't get to know.  Living with ambiguity is part of the job.  Psychotherapy is a hauntingly vast ocean of countless shades of grey and its depth is maddening.

Truly, we therapists are tasked with living with the consequences of the decisions we make in every moment.  If that's not a call to mindfulness, I don't know what is.  We have to live with doing the best we can in the moment and live with the rest (outcomes known and unknown).  There is no other choice, and no exit.
