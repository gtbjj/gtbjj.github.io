This is **not** a "how-to."  It's simply a log of what I did and how things progressed and what went wrong.

Link to controlled aggression book / podcast

Specific Contorlled Aggression episode(s) about bite progression / link to Tarheel Article

 - I did a lot of targeting and countering with a tug and went right to a belgian sleeve.  I did do some pillow work, but a bite-bar sleeve or wedge would have been a helpful intermidiate as well

#### Selection Tested / Green Dog Workout:

*I practiced this many, many, many times using a tug toy before ever doing it with a bite sleeve


#### Drive Channeling

*Note:* This is for Prey Dominant dogs (as is the case with Dean).  Read the book for Defense Dominant dogs.
