I started this post series to reflect on important moments in my jiu jitsu career -- both positive and negative.  Obviously, one of the biggest was returning to the sport after 5 1/2 years off (almost twice as long as I had been training).

I had been saving a draft titled **"motivation and memories"** so, after rewatching the [Chewjitsu video on journals](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tc7gXMs3lRw) I wanted to pull that content into a proper post.  First though, I mentioned my return to BJJ above, but I also want to note my first start in jiu jitsu.

The owner of that gym will always have a special place in my heart because at that time I was overweight, had some substance abuse problems from college, was out of a job, and had no way to pay gym dues.  Yet I mopped mats and helped with beginner boxing classes and we made things work.  To this day, I still stop by the gym when I'm in town and tell tales of yesteryear and build new memories with fresh up-and-comers with stories similar to mine.  Now, on to the present (or at least 2019)!

Here's what I noted:  

March:

> Me: [hitting a heavy bag because no one showed up for open mat] and make a comment about doing 100 days in a row of jiu jitsu (even if it's just 5 minutes of solo drills at home)

> Black Belt: "Do you think I take days off?  No!  And that's why you're going to pass everyone around you."

July:

> Brown Belt:  [after rolling] "I can't mess around with you anymore becasue I'll end up getting submitted."

August:

> (different) Brown Belt:  I really like where your game is going.  I used to be able to submit you a couple times a round, now I cant even get one."

> 8/10/19: Earned third stripe on blue belt.

December:

> (different) Black Belt: "(Austin) is officially on my 'no playtime' list now" [smiling and encouraging]

> 12/20/19: Earned fourth stripe on blue belt.

January 2020:

> (different) Black Belt: [in front of class] "Austin, how long has it been since you've competed?"

> Me: "Probably six years or so."

> Black Belt: "You're doing the world and this gym a disservice by not competing.  You're literally giving away gold medals."

February 2020:

> 2/15/19:  Earned purple belt.
