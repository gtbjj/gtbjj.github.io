"...and still this emptiness persists.
Perhaps this is as good as it gets.
When you've given up the drink, and those nasty cigarettes.
Now I leave the party early, atleast with no regrets.
I watch the sun as it comes up, I watch it as it sets.
Yeah this is as good as it gets."

James is ten years old.  He's recently been reunited with his mother after a custody battle lasting several years between the motehr and her mother.  James' mother was in recovery for substance abuse (in addition to multiple chronic medical ailments) which compounded her traumatic flashbacks and anxiety; ultimately leading to brief imprisonment.  It's my understanding that James' maternal grandmother was given temporary custody and, through a series of deceitful tactics, manipulated the legal system into obtaining more solidified guardianship.

James' mother, now sober has regained temporary custody and I am to see over their reunification process.  James is a sweet and shy boy.  Given his age and development, our sessions oscillate between different expressive mediums, play therapy, and conventional talk therapy.  James always seems flat, if not blunted, in our sessions, but I gather that he looks forward to them.  He insists on finishing one session even after vomiting (nearly on my lap!) due to having the flu.

I see james weekly for two months at school and then begin workign with his mother and her wife as a couple.  Their relationship is straind by their living circumstances, and I am envisioning workign with the entire family eventually anyway.  James makes slow and steady strides, as do his mothers in their own work, so we begin family therapy twice per week.

The family as a whole is able to make remarkable progress, specifically in their ability to soothe and grow witih each other.  I begin to taper off treatment, only seeing the family once per week and James individually every other week.  In our last session all members of the family thanked me several times for advocating for (collaboration with DFCS) and helping them.

Sincere expressions of gratitude are more rare than you think.  They are something to savor.  It's important to rembmer to do that.

James's and his family's therapy was a success by all measures and treatment concludes.  Three or four months later a colleague who had collaborated with me in working with James and his family sends a text message.  The colleague knows I don't read newspapers, so there's a picture of an obituary attached.  James' biological mother had fatally overdosed.

I don't feel guilty or responsible for perhaps prematurely stopping services.  I feel a bittersweet curiosity come over me.  I look out the window of my office as I wait for my next appointment.  The sun is rising.  I ponder over my coffee and imagine either a celebratory indulgence gone too far, or perhaps a full on relapse.  I can't imagine what catastrophe would have been required to trigger the later in the face of all the work the family had accomplished.

I stare at my phone's blank screen for several minutes, then longingly back out the window.  School busses are driving by.  I was sorrowed beyond words, but no tears came.  I feel the sun on my face and try to swallow the lesson the universe has handed me.

Nothing is guaranteed.  Not a single "thank you", not fairness, not even our next breath.  Everything can disappear in an instant without any regard for the future or the past.  Yet, what has already  happened will always continue to be so.  It's summer time.  Children are playing and laughing as they get off the bus.  I can only imagine James' mother as I last saw her, wearing humorously excessive amounts of makeup and smiling profsely ear-to-ear.
