Season:  "Winter" (December - March)
Focus:   BJJ (year-round), Climbing
Note:    Weather is "best" for climbing, so take advantage of that

**Regular Classes:**

- 30-40 min learning / drilling techniques
- 20-30 min free / live rolling

**Open Mat:**

Making my entry back into the sport, I viewed Open Mat as a time to test my overall game against upper belts as well as my  metle and durability (e.g. conditioning benchmarks such as number of total rounds, or rounds without taking one off).  But I was wondering if this was the most effective use of my time since there's a bit of live rolling in every class already.

I came across a [Making the Most of Open Mat article by Kyle Watson](http://www.watsonbjj.com/making-the-most-of-open-mat/) which cleared this up a bit.  The suggestion therein being:  50% drilling and 50% sparring (25% positional related to the techniques drilled, and 25% live rolling)

**Home Mat:**

[Nick "Chewy" Albin (Chewjitsu)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rPRMr4Ts4Is) has a great suggestion that might look something like this:

- dynamic warm up (shrimp, bridge, shoot, sprawl, etc...) (10 min)
- pick 2 techniques, drill each technique for 5 rounds of 2 min per person (40 min)
- 5 x 2 min positional sparring (e.g. reset on pass, sweep, or submission)

Right now I like using this time to troubleshoot and think through positions with a partner.  In my training logs (link) I keep note of positions I struggle with / against or submissions I have trouble defending.  Using the time in this way seems very efficient and is great *active recovery*.

We all know rolling (positional or free) is awesome and necessary, but I feel like I get that during class time.  On one hand I don't think you can ever drill too much; but on the other if you aren't actively trying to fill the holes in your game you're missing something critical.

**Winter Schedule:**

So, my schedule now looks something like this:

| Monday    | Rest / Climbing (weather pending) |
| Tuesday   | BJJ Class (1 hour) |
| Wednesday | BJJ Class (1 hour) / Climbing (weather pending) |
| Thursday  | BJJ Class (1 hour) |
| Friday    | BJJ Home Mat Time (1 hour) |
| Saturday  | Climbing (weather pending) |
| Sunday    | BJJ Open Mat (2 hours) |

| BJJ Volume | Total Training Volume |
| ---------- | --------------------- |
| 6 hours    | ~ 10 hours |

Season:  "Summer" (April - November)
Focus:   BJJ (year-round), Dog Training, More BJJ
Note:    Weather is generally poor for climbing

**Summer Schedule:**

| Monday    | Finger / Strength Day |
| Tuesday   | BJJ Class (1 hour) |
| Wednesday | BJJ Class (1 hour) |
| Thursday  | BJJ Class (1 hour) |
| Friday    | Finger / Strength Day |
| Saturday  | BJJ Class (2 hours) |
| Sunday    | BJJ Open Mat (2 hours) |

| BJJ Volume | Total Training Volume |
| ---------- | --------------------- |
| 7 hours    | ~10 hours |

*Finger Strength:  ... definitely needs kept up on in the climbing off-season.
*Conditioning:  With an average of 1 hour of mat time / day and about 1/3 of that time dedicated to live rolling; this should take care of itself.
*Strength Training:  ... will definitely include finger strength training, but may not necessarily include weight training.  It may be some kind of "active fun"; which may be in the weight room, but may also be a yoga class, pool / lake day, climbing gym, etc...
