At last!  After [much tedious trial and error testing]() I've honed my personal kernel and dubbed it ready 
for a public release.  The [source code]() is available on GitHub and individual features can be tracked.  
The kernel is a fork of [Flash Kernel](), but has been tweaked to suit [my usage habits]().  As I'm still 
new to the developer world, pull requests and suggestions are more than welcome.

**Gamers:** Be warned, that this kernel will likely be *very bad* for you as I am not an avid game and thus 
have nerfed the GPU.
