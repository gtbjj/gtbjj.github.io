The [October Android Security Update](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/android-security-updates) came out a bit early this month and, in 
record time I've spun out a fresh AOSP (OPR5.170623.007 vendor) build for the Nexus 6P.

#### Pure AOSP (upload needed!)

> Monthly rebuild with October 2, 2017 security patch.  I'm a little closer on getting things packaged to a flashable zip, so stay tuned for a 
update to the post and / or to the comments.

#### Austin's ROM

> I've been tinkering with some themeing of a few stock apps (Contacts and Messaging).  There is also a new TODO.md file in my [GitHub 
repo](https://github.com/savagezen/angler) where you can check planned features and the thigns I'm working on.
