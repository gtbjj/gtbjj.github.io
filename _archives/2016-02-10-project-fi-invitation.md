Growing tired of my Verizon bill, I did some 
looking into [Google's Project Fi](fi.google.com).  As of 
this writing Google's MVNO combining Sprint, T-Mobile, and 
WiFi networks is still invitation only.  I requested such 
an invitation and a few days later Google obliged the 
request.

After 
about a week of weighing the pros and cons I decided 
that even with footing the bill for a [Huawei Nexus 
6p](https://store.google.com/product/nexus_6p) and my early 
termination fee from Verizon (yet to be confirmed), I'd 
still save a couple hundred dollars over the next two 
years.  **That won't change your life, but if I cut  you a 
check for $100 on the first of the year for no reason, 
you'd probably enjoy it.**  True enough, I ~~am~~ would be 
elligible for a free upgrade from Verizon in late 
September, but I'm not convinced Samsung or LG are going to 
offer anything that takes the Nexus 6p out of the "best 
flagship debate."

There 
are a lot of benchmark and stat comparisons on the 
web already ([vs SGS6 
Edge+](https://www.androidpit.com/samsung-galaxy-s6-edge-plus-vs-nexus-6p-comparison) 
and [vs iPhone 
6s+](http://www.androidcentral.com/nexus-6p-versus-iphone-6s-plus)), 
but benchmarks have long since lost their relevance with 
the never ending hardware race and all.  Not to mention the 
need for more power to push through all that bloatware 
(*cough!)   That said, I've already started collecting data 
on my, by now archaic, [HTC One 
Remix](http://www.androidcentral.com/nexus-6p-versus-iphone-6s-plus) 
to compare service coverage.  I'll also plan on collecting 
real world usage stats (battery, coverage, data 
speed, etc...) on [a 
publicly shared Google Drive 
spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1LRLNCjorZRZhR7dXDEX930pN1qOU0WpHueKJNh1zFOU/edit?usp=sharing).

To say the least, I'm pretty excited!  Not only am I 
getting a **HUGE** upgrade in hardware, but I always get 
a little giddy when I get a chance to "*stick it to the 
man*."  Thanks to a couple useful reviews of Project Fi 
from [this article on 
Engadget](http://www.engadget.com/2015/12/04/google-project-fi/) 
and [this one on Android 
Central](http://www.androidcentral.com/project-fi-isnt-me-yet-its-still-really-good) 
I decided that I met the criteria for the benefiting / 
target audioence (single line, low data usage).

***Most of all I'm exciteded to hop back on XDA and go root 
wild again!***  (Yes, that's another stab at Verizon for 
locking boot loaders --- might as well mention the lack of 
hotspot functionality too!).
