#### Magnesium - Take One

Previously I looked at [blood pressure and sodium]({% post_url 2019-03-08-blood-pressure-and-sodium %}) (reduction).  The results there showed a marked improvement in my blood pressure, but soon after my blood pressure returned to it's "normal" level.  In other words, perhaps I caught myself on a *very* good day (low stress perhaps) that showed such a sudden improvement.

At the start of this experiemnt my blood pressure was 144 / 88 (77 RHR) and the **intervention** I used was remvoing read meat (so chicken and fish only) as well trying to eat [vegetables with higher magnesium content](https://www.myfooddata.com/printables/foods-high-in-magnesium-printable.png).  For the three week test period I was consuming about 300 mg magnesium / day ([sample nutrient profile](https://photos.app.goo.gl/Xn5StjnVBTjqKx1x7))

**Results:**  At the end of three weeks my blood pressure was 141 / 86 (59 RHR).  That is a very small, maybe not even significant effect.  It should also be noted that during this time I started practicing BJJ much more frequnetly and did some sort of combat related movement every day -- regarding the decrease in RHR.

#### Magnesium - Take Two

After talking with the nurse friend who recomended increasing magnesium intake in the first place, I learned that the magnesium in raw food alone would likely have little effect blood pressure without external supplmentation (see [this article also](https://www.livescience.com/55355-magnesium-blood-pressure.html)).  So, let's give this another go!

Magnesium supplements can be found at virtually any pharmacy or drug store.  One thing to look out for though is that a quick Google search will tell you that (the more common) Magnesium Oxide has a lower absorption rate than (the slightly more expensive) Magnesium Citrate.  Opt for the later.

**Intervention (dosage):**  2 x 250 mg servings / day.  This is a little high, but my daily intake was a little below the RDA (after rebalancing from *Take One* above).  However, the average was in the recommended range of about 700 - 800 mg / day between raw food and supplements.

**Results:**

| Date    | Blood Pressure | RHR |
| ------- |:--------------:|:---:|
| [2/12/19](https://photos.app.goo.gl/5VpNmRpyWyHULXdS6) | 141 / 86       | 59  |
| 2/26/19 | 132 / 78       | 63  |
| [3/29/19](https://photos.app.goo.gl/soTdGqZTuuat4Tow5) | 139 / 78       | 69  |

<br />

**Verdict:**  That is a pretty impressive efect!  Though statistical significance will be tested in the future once I've collected more data samples and can test each sample against the average.
