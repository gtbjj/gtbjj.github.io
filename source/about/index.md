title: About
---

As the name of this website (and many of my social media handles), *savagezen*, implies, I consider myself a member of the tribe of warrior poets who hold a space in their heart and mind for both wise, gratious, love and preparedness for violent chaos.

In short, I am:

* A licensed professional counselor (LPC) and have been practicing since 2015.  You can learn more about my professional works and history on [LinkedIn](https://linkedin.com/in/austinhaedicke).
* A certified nutrition coach (PN1) with Precision Nutrition.
* A compeitive JiuJitsu player (currnetly Purple Belt)  I've formerly trained and competed in boxing and MMA.  I have also bouldered up to V6/7 and traditional climbed up to 5.10b/c.
* A (working) dog lover.
* A carnivore (call it *animal-based* if you want).  You can view screenshots of my labs, data, and related graphs publicly on [Google Photos](https://photos.app.goo.gl/jrqqa6PNoXXHvM3m6).  I also have a [GitHub repo](https://github.com/savagezen/research) containing raw data from research I've conducted.  You can also find early essays, experiments, and other data sets on publicly on [Google Dirve](https://photos.app.goo.gl/jrqqa6PNoXXHvM3m6).
* An adamant supporter of regenerative agriculture and ancestral health.
* My race is *human.*
* My religion is *love.*
* My polics are *freedom.*
* My birthplace is *Earth.*

Without overcomplicating things;

* read the [posts](/) on this site,
* listen to a few [podcast episodes](/podcast),
* poke around on my [social media](https://instagram.com/savagezen),

and you'll have a pretty good idea of who I am, what I'm in to, and the message(s) I'm spreading.
