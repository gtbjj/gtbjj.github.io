title: About
---

In short...

* I am an advocate of animal-based nutrition (specifically a carnivore way of eating) and steward of regeerative agriculture.  
* Between combat sports and rock climbing I've pushed my body and mind to accomplish un-imaginable feats.  
* I work in mental health as a licensed psychotherapist (LPC).
* I am a certified nutrition coach with Precision Nutrition (PN1).
* In my "free time" I spend as much time as I can in the sun and playing with / training my GSD/Malinois mix.

Wihtout overcomplicating things;

* read the [posts](/) on this site,
* listen to a few [podcast episodes](/podcast),
* poke around on my [social media](https://instagram.com/savagezen),

and you'll have a pretty good idea of who I am, what I'm in to, and the message(s) I'm spreading.
