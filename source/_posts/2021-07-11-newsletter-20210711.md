## Personal Updates:

**The Good:**  Many adherents of a carnivore diet are plagued with diarrhea.  Admittedly this has taken me a long time to get to the bottom of, experimenting with different fasting ratios, marconutrient ratios, meal timings, fat types, etc.  What it boiled down to for me was too many calories (too much protein perhaps?) in a single sitting (meal).  Mind you, my daily requirements are somewhere between 170 - 200g protein and anywhere from 3,000 - 4,500 calories.  So, trying to get all of that in in a single meal causes problems (at least for me it did).  Naysayers will say that "ancestrally" I "should be able to" eat all my food at once; however, after spreading the meals out (e.g. a smaller fast-breaker) my diarrhea was gone and returned with the jumbo-meal-fast-breaker.

**The Bad:**  I'm still trying (unsucessfully) moderate my caffeine intake.  This week I've been at a few trainings and pulling 16 hour work-days due to international collaboration.

**The New:**  Currently I'm doing research with *breath work and blood pressure* and *comparing sleep interventions (including CBD again).*

**Gratitude:**  I'm grateful:

 * to play in the sun, 
 * for a job that I love, 
 * and to be on the mats almost every day of the week!
