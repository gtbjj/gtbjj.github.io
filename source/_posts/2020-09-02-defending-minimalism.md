As humans, and especially as performance driven athletes, and especially especially as stubborn fighters and climbers, we tend to overcomplicate things.  That is, more is not always better.  Better is better.

The latest and greatest strength (or any other) program from your favorite professional athlete, brought to you by whatever magazine cover, doesn't mean jack if A) you can't stick with it more than two weeks, or B) you can't stick with it without getting injured.  Minimalism works because consistency matters.  You may not be as special as you think.

Try simple (certainly not to be mistaken for easy) until you're absolutely sure simple doesn't work.  Don't confuse easy-hard training (more "hard" stuff you're familiar with) with hard-hard (things you're not familiar with) training.
