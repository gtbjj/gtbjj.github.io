Climbing has been my primary hobby for about four years now.  I like to 
think of myself as a veyr souldful person and as such very much adhere to 
the "soul sport" philosophy of climbing.                                

Surprisingly, I still haven't read [Steph Davis's 'High 
Infatuation'](https://www.amazon.com/High-Infatuation-Climbers-Guide-Gravity/dp/1594850658), though it's a odd paradox that I feel like I've 
already embodied much of the prose of that book -- having embarked, for better and worse, on [two dirtbag adventures of my 
own](http://rockandcode.ga/tags/#dirtbag).  I love coming across [blog posts like this 
one](http://www.erickraus.com/what-climbing-rainier-taught-me-about-setting-goals/) and being reminded of the many lessons in [Arno Ilgner's 
'The Rock Warrior's 
Way'](https://www.amazon.com/Rock-Warriors-Way-Training-Climbers/dp/0974011215/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1501686870&sr=8-1&keywords=rock+warrior+way).  

Somewhat unusually in this day and age I've been climbing outdoors just about as long as I've been climbing in a gym.  Early on, with a 
belligerent zeal, I embraced outdoor climbing as "real climbing."  To date I've ticked over 500 ascents outdoors and things are a little 
differnet.  As it turns out, time has given me a very low tolerance for climbers who condescend on or turn their nose up at climbers who have a 
different preferred style (be it indoor vs. outdoor, boulder vs. trad, etc...).

As an estblished "dirtbag", a few months ago I settled in to a new hous that's less than 10 minutes from a climbing gym.  It simply made more 
logical sense to got to the gym as much as possible to make use of this opportunity rather than stubbornly continue to stick out 2+ hour 
commutes to the crag every weekend.

However, this summer has taught me many lessons.  For one, I'm greatful to be at the crag, when I am there, again.  It is no longer, *"just 
another weekend adventure"*, but recurring special treat -- a privilege.  The acceptance of that privelege has shown itself in increased 
"stoke" as well as much needed healthy separation from ego and expectations.

On one hand there are the *"big milestones"* like a new personal record, redpoint, etc...  Then there are the *"small milestones"* that often 
get overlooked such as the spectacular views atop long pitches, or the above picture.  Somewhere in that 28 hours, I still slept 8 hours, went 
to a birthday party, and communited an unneeded 2+ hours.  

So, there is no reason to think that it couldn't have been condensed *in-a-day*, or even 12-16 hours.  The point is that on that particular 
endeavor my stoke far outlasted my skin, bone, and muscle; proving to me once again how powerfully important it is to keep "soul" in all the 
"sports" that you do.
