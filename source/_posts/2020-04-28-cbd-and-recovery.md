> This is an archived publication of a study I did in August 2019.  The product used was [Receptra Naturals Active, 15mg](https://www.cbdexamine.com/product/receptra-cbd-review-receptra-active-cbd-oil-250-mg-fresh-berry/) which is no longer in stock.  Receptra appears to have re-branded that line to to their [Relief Formula](https://receptranaturals.com/serious-relief-turmeric-33mg-1oz.html).
