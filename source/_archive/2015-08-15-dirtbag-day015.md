"Being a soloist on the rocks fits my personality in day-to-day life.
That's why I started climbing alone in the fist place,
to deal with the confusion in my head and be away from others
while focusing in my little bubble, immersed in the outdoors."
```

That is a quote from the latest issue of Rock and Ice featuring a memorial cover story on Dean Potter.  tangentially I've developed a bit of a postmortem man-crush on Dean Potter.  I heard the news and posts on social media of Dean's death, actually I first heard of it from a dear BJJ friend who advised me to ```"Be careful out there Dalton"``` (yes, it's a [Road House](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0098206/) reference).  For whatever reason I had put off watching [Valley Updrising](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt3784160/?ref_=fn_al_tt_1) --- which I absolutely loved --- until then and saw it as a worthy time, not knowing how the film ended (in reference to Dean).

Now, I'm not into slack lining, don't have pans for taking up BASE jumping, and my friends --- and mother --- who are reading this don't have to worry about me free soloing any time soon (although I must admit [solo highballs have kind of captured me](http://www.mountainproject.com/v/half-ass-roof/110882718)).  Of course I never knew Dean Potter, but the more I read, the more I feel connected in a pseudo-spiritual sense of admiration for Dean's sense of prowess and passion for the world and what  he's doing in it.  He's seems to have very much been the ```I'm gonna do what I want in order to be as free as I possibly can, and **** you if you get in the way``` kind of guy; though not out of spite, out of deep desire and commitment to his mission.

A couple days ago I was offered (and accepted) a full time job not too far from where I've been camping.  This puts me in quite an interesting position.  When i began this journey I had crossed the line and dove into the dark side.  i mentally prepared myself for something much more treacherous than three weeks (more to the tune of three or six months, or even a year if I needed to).  I had to go there,```suffering the depths of possibility``` was the only way to build enough ``courage to keep going```.

I've also committed to this lifestyle and, for now, it is enough.  It has brought on a whole new realm of consciousness in terms of what is ```"needed"``` and totally re-aligns what you ```"want"``` from yourself, your world, your life, and your friends.  I literally threw away (not counting what I sold on eBay or gave to GoodWill) at least half of everything I own.  Not to mention, dropped a small fortune at REI upgrading my camping gear for this semi-permanent endeavor.

Really though, actually having a full time job many not need to stop this journey.  After all, if you picked up anything from my manifesto then you should know that this totally ```is not about money```.  Scheduling will have a lot to do with how long I can continue on this path.  How long I ```want to``` continue is dependent on how long it remains worth it.  There are, of course a lot of peculiarities about my predicament regarding psychotherapy and that professional field, but [other more profound writers and elite athletes expressed similar prose](https://gymjones.com/knowledge/19-why).
