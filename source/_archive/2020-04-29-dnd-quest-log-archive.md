At present, I have many Dungeons and Dragons (5e) quest logs archived on this site.  There are many, many posts, so I haven't taken the time to convert them to the new (April 2020) site format as this requires updating the font matter, all internal / liquid links within each post, and purging / externalizing all referenced images (those assets have been removed to improve site performance).

I have no plans to change this in the future, but for personal reference the quest logs remain archived in the [/_drafts/archives](https://github.com/savagezen/savagezen.github.io/tree/master/_drafts/archives) section of this site's source code.  Happy dungeoning, and may the dice be with you!
