Greetings everyone!

Tomorrow is launch day and I'm stoked about it.  I've had to adjust some of the content and time frame, but we're going through with 8/14!  The date is significant because it's my 6 month anniversary as a carnivore.  Of course, as many of you know, this is not the recommended way of eating in The Kombat Kitchen.  The recommended programs are much more broad and diversely applicable.  At any rate...

* The [Telegram group](https://t.me/kombatkitchen) is now public, so feel free to invite your friends!
* The White Belt and Minors programs are still free if you download them from the [Kombat Kitchen website](/tabs/kombat_kitchen).  I had to add a fee ($0.99) for Google Play and Amazon Kindle because apparently you can't give things away there.
* The Blue Belt program will be the only other program available at launch.  The Purple, Brown, and Black Belt programs are well under way, I just wasn't able to finish them in time.
* In exchange I'll be recording a series of "About Kombat Kitchen" and FAQ videos today so that they're ready for tomorrows release.
* I'm continuing to hustle and grind to bring you guys and gals discount codes for products / companies that I believe in .  So far I've got referral links set up with:
  * [Brave Browser](https://brave.com/sav396) - *protect your privacy and earn cryptocurrency while browsing the web*,
  * [Flyby Electrolytes](https://www.flyby.co/?rfsn=4562479.acaf32) - *half the price and 2-3 times as effective as sport's drinks*, and
  * [Native Deodorant and Toothpaste](https://www.talkable.com/x/Fh8iAo) - *natural deodorant that smells good and actually works*. 
* I have one more confirmed sponsor that I can't announce just yet, but there will be actual discount codes and it's the affiliate I'm most excited about!  The Flyby electrolytes sometimes come with a coupon, but I'll be raffling mine away.  The Native link should give you a free mini-deodorant with your order.  It give me one too, which I'll also be raffling away in the future.
* Speaking of raffles, start tagging posts #kombatkitchen on Instagram and Twitter.  I have some giveaways planned already from Traditional Medicines tea to Four Sigmatic coffee.  Tagged posts will get you one raffle entry and getting a new recruit to purchase an e-book will get you ten entries, and they will get five -- just have them shoot me a message on Instagram, Telegram, or Twitter with your first and last name.  The raffle will run for 30 days.

*Keep crushing it!*
