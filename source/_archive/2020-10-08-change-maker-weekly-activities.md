Put in 4 Categories:

* Unique Abilities = skill and passion (awesome and love it): **1,285 minutes**
    *  Dog  Play / Train x 110
    *  Social Media Create Content / Scheduling x 325
    *  Meditation x 20
    *  Play / Gun / Bow x 75
    *  Reading x 140
    *  Journaling x 120
    *  BJJ / Training x 210
    *  Poscast x 285
* Competent Activities = minimum standard w/o passion (awesome but don't love it): **470 minutes**
    * Hygiene x 90
    * Meal / Prep x 135
    * BJJ / Film x 90
    * Answer Messages x 95
    * House cleaning x 60
* Excellent Activities = capable, but gives you some anxiety: **557 minutes**
    * Social Media Browsing x 207
    * Website / Online Marketing x 155
    * Online Dating x 20
    * Analytics / Goal Planning / Systems x 175
* Incompetent Activities = you hate it and it stresses you out : **210 minutes**
    * In-Person Marketing x 180
    * Grocery Shopping x 30

*Summary:*  

> From a self satisfaction standpoint that looks like a pretty good ratio.  There are some things you hate and that stress you out that you're still going to have to do.  Fortunately, that was what I spent the least time doing.  In contrast, I spent, by far, the majority of my time doing things that I love and find fulfilling (#winningatlife).  Then, in the middle, things I do to a minimum standard (without passion) and that I'm capable of but give me some anxiety were about even.  The punch line is this <code>the time spent on "unique abilities" was more (barely) than the other three categories combined.</code>  That seems to be the catalyst  for a thriving life.  But, what about a thriving business..... (below)

High-Leverage Activities I Didn't Work On:

* N/A

*Summary:*

> More good news here!  <code>I spent more time on high-leverage activities than low leverage activities.</code>  Obviously some low-leverage things like house cleaning and hygiene will always be necessary; as will the things like meditating and playing because if you don't have a thriving life (part 1), then you won't have the energy to produce a thriving business.  Things like reading and journaling got included in the high-leverage group because most of my reading and journaling is based around business development as of late.

Block one appointment for yourself / week "just to think":

* I don't have a formula for this, but have a very intuitive sense of when I want to "do more" or "go harder."
* I like to listen listen to podcasts.  Sometimes I have headphones in all day, but eventually get to a point where I'm tired of hearing someone's voice.
* For Example:  Sometimes I listen to the radio or podcasts while driving, but  more often than not I listen to nothing at all and just let my thoughts roam.

This article pairs well with a later activity ([Jar of Rocks](/assets/docs/changemaker-rocks.pdf)).  Our resources (time, money, etc...) are limited, like the space in a jar.  We all have different things that go into the  jar, but all those things fall in to one of three categories:

* **Big Rocks:**  These are the big ticket life items like family, housing, food, clothing, health.  We need to make sure we've got room (resources) for all our "big rocks" first.
* **Little Rocks:**  These are technically non-essential, but they give fulfillment, fun, meaning, and purpose to our lives: "passion projects", hobbies, excelling at work, competing as an athlete.
* **Sand:**  This is the filler, the nice-to-haves.  It can be fun, but it can also take up way too much space.  <code>If we fill our jar with too  much sand first, we don't have room for the big rocks</code>.  Sand is things like watching TV, playing video games, going drinking (alcohol or coffee), social media (scrolling).
