Week 2 of the #carnivore75hard challenge is in the books.  Here are my thoughts and observations:

For me, **the hardest part** is fasting (consistently).  At first it felt really good and much more efficient to spend less time in the kitchen (cooking and cleaning) and just not think about food as much.  However, fasting feels good until it doesn't.  What I mean is that like any new routine, it's easy to be motivated initially, but eventually life throws us a hiccup and we have to decide if we're going to keep going or allow ourselves an excuse to quit.

Many people, as did I, experience **diarrhea** when starting a carnivore diet.  I found the return of this when I was manipulating my fat:protein ration really high.  This is part of some testing I'm doing, though it doesn't have anything to do with the challenge itself.  Typically my fat:protein ration tends to be between 1:1 and 2:1 by calorie.  The [paleomedicina](https://www.paleomedicina.com/paleolithic-ketogenic-diet/) protocol suggests a 2:1 fat:protein ratio *by weight* -- which comes to a little over 4:1 by calorie.

I'd rather chew the fat rather than drink it -- as I've commented before on my issues with a keto diet.  With the current COVID19 / supply chain issues, it's been hard to find suet in stock.  I did achieve the appropriate fat levels when eating (pork) backfat.  However, the pork drastically increased my Omega-6:Omega-3 ratio.  So, I've had to settle for adding copious (unnatural?) amounts of tallow and ghee.

Speaking of **Omega-3** and Omega-6 fatty acids, another subset of the current studies I'm doing is manipulating my O6:O3 ratio.  So, I've tried been trying to eat more fish (salmon and sardines) this week.  Fresh fish significantly more expensive than ruminant meat and I'm not sure the cost is worth the benefit (that's why I'm testing the effect!).  Unfortunately though, I've settled for canned fish, though I'm extremely hesitant of the heavy metal content in canned fish -- regardless of WHO "permissible guidelines" ([r](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16917712), [r](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/321242872_Heavy_metals_contamination_of_canned_fish_and_related_health_implications_in_Iran), [r](http://www.bioline.org.br/pdf?ja13065)).

Overall though, while fish is higher in Omega-3 concentration and fish like salmon are considered "fatty", they don't contain enough fat to meet a 2:1 fat:protein requirement, let alone the 4:1 recommendation from Paleomedicina.
