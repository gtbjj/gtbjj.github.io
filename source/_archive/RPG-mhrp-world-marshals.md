#### Event:  World Marhals

#### Act V:

*The Lightningbolts' hellicarrier is under attack by Green Goblin, Sinister, and Carnage.  Meanwhile, Raiden has defeated Sebastian Shaw, but is under the influence of his ripper-mindset, augmenting his power significantly, but also increasing the threat of the Goblin Serum implanted in him to take effect.*

#### On the Hellicarrier

- Fantomex and Punisher exchange artilery with Spider Slayers
- Storm tries to distract Green Goblin and Carnage witih Thunder / Lightning
- Deadpool takes on Sinister, but seem ineffective at stopping the other
- Fantomex / Punisher success
- Storm overwhelmed by Goblin Bombs from gliders and takes heavy melee from Carnage and takes minor beating
- Punisher uses Raiden's Railgun to knock Carnage of Glider
- Fantomex chases / exchanges artilery with Green Goblin who opens fire on Deadpool
- DP / FX not able to catch gliders and are dodging cover
- Sinister flees

#### On the Ground

- Sinister tries to antagonize amped up Raiden
- Raiden can't resist "boundless combat" - Sinister's mind trick to pit Raiden against his allies
- Norman comes to Sinister's aide as the remote fly one glider (w/ Raiden) back up to Hellicarrier

#### Back at the Scene

- Deadpool's punns are enough to actually give Carnage a headache
- Storm too weak to create a storm to control Carnage, but charges Railgun
- Punisher makes sly comment about "they're a good team" (crushin' hard)
- Fx and Deadpool assault Carnage with gunfire and witty quips, but take some damage due to Carnage now "fighting like a cornered dog"
- Railgun temporarily separates Cassidy from Symbiote
- Storm whips them out of the carrier

#### Then

- Sinister and Norman return with a rampage-ready Raiden
- S/N back on gliders, Raiden on foot
- Sinister antagonzies Raiden, tells him team left him for dead against Shaw
- W/ Raiden and Goblin attacking others, FX tries to reason with Raiden
- Sinister tries to BFR storm, but she goes into a rage herself which engulfs the entire carrier in a tornado
- Seeing the lighting, something changes in Raiden's mind, he's a bit frozen in time; gazing around at the chaos; he watches Goblin KO; remote glider bring back Carnage who gives Deadpool all he can handle
- Telepathic connection with FX, who "brings Raiden back to reality"
- "I am the Lightning!"
- Raiden rages after Sinister, tanking brutal hits.  Sinister struck with fear when he sees he's drawn the full attention of enraged Storm and Semi-Ripper-Raiden (focused effort of FX's misdirection / "reality skewing" to help Raiden focus)
- Raiden and Storm slaughter Sinister
- Storm steadies her mind and tells DP to focus fire on gliders
- Storm surrounds Carnage in thunder while DP KOs
- Norman flees with UCS Sinister, needing all efforts to meerely evade a still furious Raiden
- Tornado has settled with Storms composure, but this allows Norman to escape
- Storm convinces Raiden not to chase after as the team and their ship are in bad need recovery -- not to mention needing to "dispose" of Carnage
