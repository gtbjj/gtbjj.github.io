[Conky](https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/conky) is a great tool for 
monitoring your Linux system.  With endless possibilities for catchy graphic 
design, your respective Linux distribution forum probably has at 
least one forum thread dedicated to sharing screenshots and configurations 
of the tool.

About two years ago, after having been using Arch Linux for about 6 months or so,  I decided to take up [The Arch 
Way](https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Arch_Linux#Principles) a bit more seriously.  I rid my system of all GUIs and made a serious 
effort to downsize and strive for minimalism; not only for performance 
but for the sake of learning.

At any rate, switching to a window manager from a full desktop 
environment left me with a stale looking conky.  This post will 
detail some tools and resources to *put pzaz back in your usespace!*

### Initial Resources:

1. To get conky working with your wm's status bar, look at [dzen](https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Dzen).
2. To start conky on login see [this prior post](https://gtbjj.github.io/linux/troubleshooting/2016/03/01/Start-Conky-on-X-Login.html) on the subject.
3. Bookmark a [list of possible conky objects](http://conky.sourceforge.net/variables.html).
4. If you're going minimal, [conky-cli](https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/conky-cli/) should save a little disk space and overhead.

### 1) Clickable Areas and Pop-Ups:

The [relevant Arch Wiki section for dzen](https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Dzen#Clickable_areas_and_popups) is pretty clear and easy to 
implement.  This will allow you to, as featured in the above image, keep a very clean and minimal constant output while maintaining great 
functionality.  For example, the things I want to constantly be able to 
peek up and see in the corner of my screen may include:

> 1. Time
> 2. Battery status
> 3. CPU usage / temperature
> 4. Memory usage

The pop-ups, then, still give access to information you may want to get to quickly but don't necessarily need to keep constant watch on, like:

> 1. Disk usage
> 2. Calendar / weather
> 3. Uptime / login / mountpoints
> 4. Package and upgrade transactions

### 2) Icon Fonts:

Minimalists have to take their eye candy where we can get it!  So, instead 
of a gaudy *MEM* or *CPU* text in the output, you can 
implement tiny images or "*iconfonts*."

> Gather the necessary open source content:

```
$ git clone https://github.com/windelicato/dotfiles.git 
/tmp/dotfiles

$ mv /tmp/dotfiles/.xmonad/dzen2 ~/.icons/
```

> Link to the specific icon file in your conky config:

```
~/.conkyrc
---
^i($HOME/.icon/dzen2/mem.xbm) ${memperc}%
```

### 3) Blinking Integer Ranges:

This can add a lot of flare as well.  Rather than the same colors in the corner of your screen, you can configure conky to blink under 
specified conditions.  You do that with a shell-like ```if / else``` statement.  Common implementations for this would be *memory usage, cpu 
temperature, and battery percentage*.

For example, let's say you want to have your battery monitor blink and turn red at a threshold value of 10%.  In the example below this means 
that when the battery percentage is at 10 or lower, conky will A) change icons, B) turn the icon red, and C) start blinking the icon.

```
~/.conkyrc
---
$ {if_match ${battery_pecent BATC} <= 10}^fg(\#ff535a)${blink ^i($HOME/.icon/dzen2/battery_10.xbm)}^fg(\#eeeeee)${else}^i($HOME/.icons/dzen2.battery.xbm)${endif}
```

### Conclusion:

There you have it, minimal doesn't have to be bland!  You 
could even take it all the way and have only icons with 
respective pop-ups for each of them.  However, to me, that is only 
visually minimal and is a functional hassle that violates the KISS 
principle. 

In review you can spice up your conky one-liner via:

> 1. Changing font and color 
> 2. Adding clickable areas with pop-up information
> 3. Including icons
> 4. Configuring conditional blinking output
