*From [my BUGS page](https://github.com/savagezen/x205ta/blob/master/BUGS.md) for the Asus X205TA.*

The touchpad should work on kernels 4.3* [[1]](https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Asus_x205ta#Touchpad) (confirmed on kernel 4.3.3-2-ARCH), but if you still run into problems on another kernel, you can proceed with the following.

First, make sure that you have ```xf86-input-synaptics``` installed.  To enable more features of the touchpad:`

Then,

```
# nano /etc/X11/xorg.conf.d/elan_synaptics.conf
---------------------------------------------------
Section "InpuClass"
Identifier "Elan Touchpad"
MatchIsTouchpad "on"
Driver "synaptics"
EndSection
```

Things should work as normal when you start up X again.
