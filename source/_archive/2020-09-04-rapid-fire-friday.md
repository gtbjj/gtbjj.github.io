This is the first video in the FAQ series for Kobmat Kitchen.  Inspired by Andy Stumpf's "Full Auto Friday" I try to answer 5 of your diet, nutrition, performance, lifestyle questions in under one minute each.  Today's topics include:

- Why should we trust you?
- How many calories do I need?
- What macronutrient ratios do you follow in The Kombat Kitchen?
- Do I have to be a carnivore to do Kombat Kitchen?
- Isn't eating healthy and eating meat expensive?
