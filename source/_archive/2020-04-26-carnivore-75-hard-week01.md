Week one of the [#carnivore75hard](https://nutritionwithjudy.com/carnivore75hard/) challenge is in the books!  One of the things I appreciate about the challenge, from a psychological perspective its wrap around planning for behavioral intervention.  So, first off I wanted to elaborate on a few points of the program:

**Know Your Why:**  What drives you towards change?

> For me it is always pushing performance and recovery forward, always becoming harder to kill be that through physical training, mental growth, or nutrition.  Longevity and sustainability of weight management are also important to me.  The more simple a plan is, the more likely I'll adhere to it for longer.

**If This, Then That:**  What's your backup plan for unexpected stressors?

> This is super important.  As I've mentioned before, you're going to hit a lot more roadblocks and potholes in 75 days than a standard 30 day challenge (e.g. you might be able to avoid your friends and the pub for 30 days, but obviously a lack of social interaction is going to have deleterious effects in the long run).  So, if I get sugar cravings (surprisingly rare on carnivore) I'll eat something savory (salty and fatty!).  At social events when people are drinking alcohol I'll bring or order sparkling water.  If I'm lacking sleep or craving caffeine I'll take a nap and a cold shower.  When I feel stress building up or feel frustrated or angry, I'll do some boxing, go for a walk (preferably in the sun), and call a friend to talk about it.

**In 1 Year, 5 Years, and 10 Years:**  Where do you see your life?  Where do you see yourself?  What do you want to accomplish or achieve?

> In the next *one year* I want to compete in BJJ again and revive my dating life.  In the next *five years* I want to earn my black belt in BJJ, establish a long term relationship, earn a SPEAR or dog training certification.  In *ten years*, it's a cloud (at best) vision for myself, but I'd imagine wanting children and perhaps having my own business related to combat sports and dog training.

**In 15 Minutes...**

> This a really good concept too.  *If you only had 15 minutes of free time / day, how would you use it?"*  Honestly, the best use in my opinion would be to call (**not text**) a friend just to chat.

### Process Notes:

* Anecdotally I feel like my testosterone has increased with the fasting
* Fasting 16 hours actually isn't as bad as I thought, typically my day looks like this:
    * 5:30 - wake up and journal
    * 6:00 - work out / play with dog
    * 6:30 / 7:00 - Meal 1
    * 13:00 - Meal 2 (sometimes this was OMAD if I was fasting closer to 20 hours)
    * 14:00 - 21:00 - Work
    * 22:00 - bed (8 hours of the fast were at work, and 8 were asleep)
* My mood also seems much better this week, but that's also because my work schedule has normalized and I'm getting out in the sun more (e.g. I was on swing shifts overnight the last few weeks).  I think, too, the "community" part of the challenge -- complimenting someone -- actually help my mood and makes me feel better regardless of how someone else takes it.  I'm definitely not one to brown-nose, so I'm not for superficial comments, the point is that you start to develop a *habit of seeking your own happiness.*
* When experimenting with super high protein ratios I felt my elbows aching a bit and did have fat sleight fat cravings.
