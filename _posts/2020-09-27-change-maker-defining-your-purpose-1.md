*As I work my way through the [Change Maker](http://carnivorejiujitero.com/feed.xml) book I'll be publicly posting the worksheets and discussion points.*

**Question 1:**  *Why do you want to work in health and fitness in the first place?*

> I have invested innumerable hours in my own health and fitness.  Literally 1,000 hours for my purple belt, hundreds of hours climbing, and hundreds more listening to podcasts, lifting, and training.  As I grow in age and maturity I see more synergy in the worlds I work in (fitness and mental health).  In the last 6 months or so I've had a specific growing interest in the overlap between mental health and nutrition.  

> I don't just want to help people, I want to empower them to make better choices for themselves.  This is true in the therapy room and in the kitchen.  I want to create opportunities and be a catalyst for other people's success.  This is somewhat selfish as I'm not sure what I'll be capable of as an athlete, but I believe I have a gift for teaching and a contagious presence that's conducive to coaching.

**Question 2:**  *Do you want to work with clients / patients?  If yes, what type of clients do you want to work with?  If no, what do you gravitate toward instead?*

> Yes!  I want to work with athletes or competitive persons in general.  Specifically I want to usher the benefits of animal-based nutrition towards combat sports athletes.  Niche groups of athletes like fighters (or climbers for that matter) are notoriously suborn.  This makes them great at overcoming difficult tasks, but terrible at accepting new ideas.  Heaven knows there is 50 years of bad nutritional advice lingering around.

> I am not opposed to working with novices either.  I think that doing so can teach us a lot about ourselves.  In addition, many competitive athletes (myself included) tend to over think things and it can be helpful to step back to a more principally driven approach periodically.

**Question 3:**  *Do you really want to help other people?*

> I think so, for the most part.  I consider myself the test subject for anything I might recommend to my clients.  At the same time, I'm not the least bit interested in creating mini-mes.  What I am interested in is producing performance.  I have no doubt that the lessons I learn from my clients (be they about life or nutrition) will pay dividends to my own life as well.

> From a spiritual perspective, I mostly default to agnosticism, though mostly I'm just confused(!).  That said, it meas a great deal to me to be connected with and be able to create changes in the communities and relationships I'm involved in.

**Question 4:**  *Do you want to own or run a business?*

> Definitely.  For years I've been stifled by my own nomadic wanderlust.  'The call the wild' as it was, was too strong.  You need to find a locale and a community to embed yourself in to start a successful private practice (mental health).  Logistically that hadn't happened until now.

> There were also some choices made beyond my control that forced, or rather allowed, me to start looking at alternative (or at least additional) career options.  The types of (mental health) patients I enjoy working with tend towards the acute (severe) side.  There is tremendously high risk with this population such that I refuse to do tele-therapy with them.  Nutritional coaching, however, has a lower risk level.

> For the time being I can have a little steak and eat it too by serving the mental health patient's I'm passionate about, while providing nutrition coaching to my own community through distance communication.  Not having corporate support also means not having the limitations of the corporate system imposed on you.
