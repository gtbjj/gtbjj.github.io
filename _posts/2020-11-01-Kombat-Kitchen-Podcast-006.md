Quan is an outstanding clinician and woman who I'm truly honored to have shared the consulting room with as a co-therapist and colleague. Throughout this episode we talk about growth and changes in our styles and "non-professional" personalities throughout our careers and start to touch on the current political climate and the effects of socio-economics and geography on mental health. There is a podcast called "therapists uncensored", but I doubt they get into the grit and grist of "the person of the therapist" as we do here and as I will with other clinicians on the show.
