  <strong>(noun)</strong> | <i>A state of being</i>
</p>

> The transient state oscillating between serenity and chaos amid fulfillment of both creative and destructive energies ultimately coalescing in the pursuit and challenging of human nature.  Embrace that violence is always an option and savor life's tranquil moments.  Be relentless in the pursuit of what sets your soul on fire.  <i>Amor fati.</i>

My name is Austin Haedicke.  I'm am one of the only animal-based nutrition coaches in West Georgia.  Specifically, I am the only <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/pn_cert.jpg">Precision Nutrition, PN1 excercise nutrition</a> certified person in Villa Rica, GA.  Between Carroll, Paulding, and Douglas counties there are 9 PN1 certified coaches.  I am the only one of those to also be <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/lpc.pdf">licensed as a professional counselor</a>. 

I am a purple belt in Brazilian Jiu Jitsu (under <a href="https://www.atlbjj.com/">Ranieri Paiva</a>), training at <a href="https://integritybjj.com/">Integrity BJJ & Fitness</a>.  I have competed in BJJ, wrestling, boxing, MMA, and rock climbing.  I have climbed multiple V6s boulders, and multiple 5.10 traditional routes.  My journey is well documented in <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/#blog">my blog</a> and <a href="https://instagram.com/savagezen">on Instagram</a>.  I have undergraduate degrees in criminal justice and philosophy, and a master's degree in psychology.  In my "free time", I like training working / sport dogs.

### What Principles and Values Do You Serve?

You can read about my process of founding Kombat Kitchen in <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/tags/#change%20maker">blog posts tagged "change maker."</a>  In addition, Kombat Kitchen was created to meet two fundamental needs:

<ol>
    <li>Bring animal based nutrition to combat sports athletes to improve their performance and reduce stress and anxiety in their lives.</li>
    <li>Educate and empower everyday people to <code>#fightforyourhealth</code>.  That means living an active life you enjoy, shedding fat you've held on to for years, and feeling like food is your friend; not the enemy.</li>
</ol>
