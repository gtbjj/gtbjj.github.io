*As I work my way through the [Change Maker](https://amzn.to/347aR2i) I'll be publicly posting the worksheets and discussion points.*

**Prompt:** *Think of the Time You Felt the Happiest*

> The last semester of graduate school I was operating at an intense pace.  I had 3 courses, was interning 30 hours / week, working as a TA, and working at the school rock wall.  But, I was extremely well supported in all of those areas AND there was a lot of synergy between them, they were feeding each other.

> Shortly after graduate school, I started my wanderlust.  I had a part time job, making just enough money to feed myself, working a few days per week.  The rest of the week I spent living in my car and climbing in the mountains (not as glamorous as Instagram makes it out to be, I can assure you -- dig into the archives of this site and you'll the illustration).  At any rate...

* What were you doing?
    * Example 1:  teaching, researching, clinical work
    * Example 2:  active, outdoors, freedom (no rigid schedule)
* Who were you with?
    * Example 1:  mentors (lots of them), friends who enjoy the things I enjoy
    * Example 2:  myself (good and bad, ups and downs)
* What else was involved that contributed to the feelings of happiness?
    * Example 1:  support and synergy, satisfaction in the work, loving and being loved
    * Example 2:  freedom, opportunity

**Prompt:** *Think of the Time You Were Most Proud*

> Passing LAPC licensing exam:  At the time I was going through graduate school there were major changes to the licensing requirements and department credentialing, so it was a huge relief to pass the exam.

> First MMA fight (adversity): This was one of two very desperate times in my life and I wasn't getting a lot of family support.  So, it was a huge accomplishment to come away with a decisive win.

* Why were you proud?
    * Example 1:  overcoming policticing, credentials to vouch for my skills
    * Example 2:  overcoming a lot of adversity, doing what I said I could do
* Who else shared in your pride?
    * Example 1:  a small handful of colleagues and friends that really understood the hurdles I'd crossed
    * Example 2:  teammates, coaches, friends
* What else was involved that contributed to the feelings of pride?
    * Example 1:  unfavorable odds
    * Example 2:  struggle after struggle

**Prompt:** *Think of the Time You Were Most Fulfilled?*

> Patient Letter:  I've kept every gift, letter, and postcard I've gotten from a patient because, frankly they aren't very common and no one tells you in graduate school how much that stuff matters.  One particularly sentimental letter, with some mutual fondness from me to the patient, came from "Jessica."

> Purple Belt:  Any belt promotion in BJJ is special, again, because they aren't that common.  This one was particularly important for me because I had taken almost 6 years off of training after only training for about 3 years.  Within about one year of returning I went from a very rusty 2-stripe blue belt to purple belt at a new academy.  It was my "didn't quit belt."

* What need or desire was fulfilled?
    * Example 1:  Deep human connection, unequivocally changing someone's life, unexpected appreciation
    * Example 2:  Recognition, a new challenge, making my coach(es) proud
* How and why did the experience give your life meaning?
    * Example 1 & 2:  With a psychologically minded eye, it's pretty clear to see that those things (desires / needs) that were fulfilled were missing or at least in a very deprived state; hence the emotional response they provoked when they occurred.
* What other factors contributed to your feelings of fulfillment?
    * Example 1 & 2:  I'm not sure what effect it had on me, but both of these situations happened in semi-public venues (in front of other people).  I'm sure that contributed greatly to the feelings of validation.

**Prompt:** *Think of the Time You Felt Most at Peace, Full of Vitality and Flow*

> The first example in the first prompt, at the end of my graduate career describes an "on fire" flow state pretty well.

> In regard to peacefulness, when I was hired at the hospital I'm at now it took everything I had to not break down into tears in the HR office when I was offered the position -- again, wanderlust isn't all it's cracked up to be.  It was a sense that I didn't have to fight quite so hard, that I could lay  my head down and rest a bit.

* What were you doing?
    * Example 1:  NOT pacing myself to other people, asking only how far / fast / hard could I push myself and going for it.
    * Example 2:  Taking a risk.  Being confident.  Being myself.
* Who were you with?
    * Example 1:  mentors, lots of them, friends (lots of them too)
    * Example 2:  an HR rep, parenthetically one of the aforementioned mentors was the "second interview" whom the HR rep called immediately to see if I could do the second interview right away since I was traveling from out of town.  When I arrived the manager (mentor) said; "I was going to hire you anyway, I just wanted you to drive up here so I could ask you how you've been."
* What else was involved that contribute to the feelings of energy, peace, and flow?
    * Example 1:  I mentioned synergy earlier.  I felt "fed" by the experience, so while it seemed overwhelming to from the outside, the energy was very cyclic.  What I was learning in the academy was being immediately applied in the clinic, and vice versa.  I love climbing, and spending time doing that with my friends was far from "another thing on the to-do list" and as was fueling energy into my life rather than consuming it.
    * Example 2:  see above

### Reflection

I actually quite enjoy that I have to take some time reflecting on and honestly answering these questions.  They're like mini-meditation prompts.  In general that seems to be the trend with the whole book.  I read along, but have to make a to-do list of worksheets and tasks for myself to follow up on.  It's kind of nice actually; very *anti-textbook.*  I dig it.

Each of them on their own could fill several pages of of, or an entire journal.  Though, I've become aware that these prompts are much more optimistic leading than one's I would have likely come to on my own.  

I've journaled before on trying to *recreate* a time when I was happy (graduate school era), but I don't think that's the purpose of this post.  This post is more directed as identifying themes in the above scenarios and trying to draw lessons from them since, obviously, you can't recreate the past -- it will always be unique to the people and places of as they were at that time (not as they are now).
