21 days.  Done.  There were some big shifts this week that I took note of.  My upcoming statistics report on a 90-day carnivore review will take a while to crunch the numbers (even after the sample is collected) because of covariance and uncontrolled variables.

I say that as a preface to some of the things I note here.  Statistically they may not match up, but as usual, all research starts with anecdotes.

**5/5**:  This week I implemented black out curtains in my bedroom.  It's part of cleaning up my sleep hygiene (week ones saw a regular bed/wake time, week two saw a bedtime routine of yoga and reading).  So, what's important here is that 5/5 was the first night I've *ever* slept 8 hour straight.  I mean out cold, no bathroom breaks, **and** beat my alarm clock up by half an hour!

**5/6**:  I finally nixed sugar free gum.  It's been in and out of my carnivore experience, more of a work habit than "something I need."  At any rant, I did find that my (urine) ketone levels were slightly higher.  However, it's hard to tell how much because the legend on the bottle has large interval gaps (0, 5, 15, 40...), so I've had to estimate the values.  I also noted feeling like my testosterone (sex drive specifically) was higher with higher ketone levels.

**5/8**:  This is the **second time this week** I've slept straight through the night!  Twice in one week versus never in my life (that I can remember).  Again, I beat my alarm clock up by half an hour.  However, I did only sleep 6 1/2 hours.

**5/9**:  Several things happened today.  It was my longest fast to date, 25 hours.  25 hours that ended with 2 hours of jiu jitsu sparring.  I wouldn't really recommend that, but it's how my scheduled ended up so I *rolled* with it.  What's more though was that this was a low sodium day for me.  I also did my usual 500 kb swings and 150 overhead presses before going to jiu jitsu.  Clocking in at about 2g sodium I felt terrible!  This was even with an electrolyte supplement (again, planned and scheduled).  Throughout the rest of the day I felt awful:  incredibly fatigued, sore, headache, etc... all of this is even before going to bed!

This is where I was mentioning that the statistics might not line up, but the sweat / intensity of jiu jitsu (particularly in a gi) isn't matched by many things.  If I were to have conducted the same experiments I've been doing over the past 30 days while training jiu jitsu regularly I think there would be a much different story regarding sodium (I've already been through this twice before:  [here]({% post_url 2019-03-08-blood-pressure-and-sodium %}) and [here]({% post_url 2020-04-28-sodium-and-recovery %})).
