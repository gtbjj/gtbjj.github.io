#### Preface:

**Balfador Bombador** was a bit of an obscure HIll Dwarf.  He never seemed to stay in one place
for long.  While he was generally a kind-hearted spirit, a few specific
loves seemed to drive his life:  cigars, money, and the thrill of the
chase.

He had worked in the mountains for some time and years of mining had left
him hard of hearing.  However, his eyesight and other senses became very
keen.  

Balfador wasn't the typical strength-based dwarf you might expect, or the
stealth-based rogue either.  Rather he is sharp and perceptive, but by no
means subtle.

#### Into the Fold:

Balfador enters a saloon in the foothill town of Cellan.  It is dirty
and it appears to be a hotbed of small-time crooks, criminals, gamblers,
and thieves.  Balfador enters the saloon, his hood dripping fromt he
heavy rain, and see's a greeter (commoner) across the room standing next
to a door.  The commoner seems sleezy and his sale's pitch is unappealing
to Balfador, however, Balfador follows him through the door where there
is another commoner behind the bar and two others playing dice at a table.

Balfador lights a cigar and approaches the dice players, sizing them up
along the way.  He doesn't notice anything particularly dangerous or odd
about them other than a sizeable money pouch on the rear hib of the
furthest commoner.  

The two grit their teeth for a minute before deciding to attempt to hustle
Balfador in a game of Odd-or-Even.  After losing nearly 40 gp over 5 turns
in a row, Balfador begins to get frustrated.  He puffs fervently on his
cigar, calmly draws his shortsword and *"asks"* the far commoner to
empty his coin pouch.  

The crooks protest, so Balfador rests his cigar on the table and attacks!
After a moderate scuffle, the two commoners are incapacitated and
Balfador's keen perception paid off as he discovered several sets of
rigged dice.  He decides to finish his cigar while resting at the bar.
The other patrons don't appear in the mood to say otherwise.

Balfador talks to the bartender, who says his name is Elligh, and asks
him if "there is anything but booze being bought or sold in this
establishment?"  Eligh dismisses the greeter back to his post (as a
lookout).  "I'm always looking to make a profit" says Elligh, who presses
a button under the bar which causes the liquor shelf to turn 180';
revealing an assortment of used (and fairly crude, though workable)
equipment and tools.  

Elight says, in a swarmy voice, "They're a little lood stained, but
if you're shopping here then I suspect you're no foreigner to the criminal
life."  Balfador is able to disband of much of his unneeded equipment and
trade it to complete his Breaching Tool Set.  While balfador is leaving,
Elligh asks, "Not that it's any of my business, but what are you planning
to do wtih all of that?"  

Balfador rubs out his cigar and says; "The Nobles that were robbed last
week... I'm going to get their money."  "You mean retrieve it for them?"
Elligh asks.  Balfador replies "I'm going to find the theives and take
the money.  I didn't say anything about giving it back.  By the way, I'll
take that studded leather armor you've got hanging back there."
