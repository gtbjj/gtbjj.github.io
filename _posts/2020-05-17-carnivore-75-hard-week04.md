Alright folks, her are my reflection points for week 4 of the [#carnivore75hard](/tags/carnivore75hard) challenge.

**5/11:**  I slept straight through the night again!  Again, for about 6 hours *and* woke up before my alarm, though I decided to take a *"nap"* for the extra hour.

**5/12:**  It's my birthday!  Once again, I nearly slept through the night (about 6 1/2 hours), peed and took another *"nap"*.

**5/13:**  I read a [recent article on Carnivore Aurelius about diarrhea](https://carnivoreaurelius.com/carnivore-diet-diarrhea/) and can confirm at least one cause.  We all know that (even without fiber) diarrhea tends to be a problem when first starting a carnivore diet.  However, I have found that for me, when I consume added processed fats, the diarrhea returns -- and stops when I remove them.  I know that tallow was a main offender and that I did not have the issue with butter.  I don't know about ghee, since I haven't used it in a while and when I did it was in conjunction with tallow.


**5/14:**  I had to wake up especially early this morning and had a longer than usual day ahead of me (due to lockdowns I'm having to pick up some odds and ends work shifts where/whenever I can get them).  I broke my caffeine trend pretty severely (about 700 mg), but was able to get back on track the next day.

As an aside, I did feel pretty *"perky"* after the first 300mg dose especially having been on a "*decaf only"* protocol for about a week (40 - 60 mg / day).  This is something I had speculated about in [my last study]({% post_url 2020-05-12-carnivore-90-day-review-01 %}) regarding changes in dosing and building a tolerance.
