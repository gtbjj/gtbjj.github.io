```"There is scarcely any passion without struggle." ~ Albert Camus```

```"There is no normal life that is free of pain.  It's the very wrestling with our problems that can be the impetus for our growth." ~ Mr. Rogers```

Years before I had read [Irvin Yalom's *Love's Executioner*](https://amzn.to/35laXoa) I began collecting and documenting stories with a select group of patients who I felt were not only marked turning points of growth in my professional career, likewise left an impression on who I am as a person.

I have waffled back and forth many times as to what I wanted to accomplish by sharing such stories.  Perhaps it would be to illustrate "what I wish I had learned in graduate school" or maybe to offer what I could to future therapists or non-practitioners along the lines of [*The Examined Life*](https://amzn.to/38s0WI5).  Maybe it was *only* to serve as catharsis for my own internal struggle or to painfully point to the astonishing rates of "burn out" in the mental health field ([1](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3156844/)).

What's more is that like Yalom's work, a number of years have passed since I originally authored some of these stories.  This provides a sort of meta-reflection -- reflecting on my reflections of a case at the time of, or shortly after I was treating the individual.  I will try my best to preserve the original content and leave my original thought process intact and save any commentary for afterword.
