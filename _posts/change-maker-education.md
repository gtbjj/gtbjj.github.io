### Evaluating CEUs (before)

**Will it provide me with specific information I wouldn't otherwise have?**

**Willit provide info I can immediately apply in my interaction with clients and staff?**

**Is it delivered by one of the best?  Can they speak from an experienced, in-the-trenches perspective?  Or are they academics who haven't worked with clients in years?**

**Is it part of a comprehensive long-term personal development plan designed to help me achieve a deep master of my craft and lead to my ultimate career goals?**

Change Maker:  Brackets and Big Rocks

sports bracket for learning opportunities
    - even for daily tasks (see weekly activities)

What are your "big rocks" that need to fit in your jar first?

*

What are the "little rocks" that are important too, but not essential?

*

What is the "sand"  / filler that is nice to have?

*

If you fill your jar (limited time / money / resources) with sand first, there isn't room for the more important "rocks."
