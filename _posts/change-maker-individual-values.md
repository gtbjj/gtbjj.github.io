### Reflection

I actually quite enjoy that I have to take some time reflecting on and honestly answering these questions.  They're like mini-meditation prompts.  Each of them on their own could fill several pages of of, or an entire journal.

In general that seems to be the trend with the whole book.  I read along, but have to make a to-do list of worksheets and tasks for myself to follow up on.  It's kind of nice actually; very *anti-textbook.*  I dig it.

**I've become aware that:** These prompts are a much more optimistic reflection on my career thus far than I would have told on my own...
