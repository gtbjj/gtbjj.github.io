You need to be responsible for know what can kill you when you're NOT climbing.  For example, while marching into Rocktown the other day I ran into [this guy](https://instagram.com/p/5-73McwDtW/?taken-by=southeastdirtbag)

![Copperhead](https://scontent.cdninstagram.com/hphotos-xfa1/t51.2885-15/s640x640/sh0.08/e35/11856698_1682268135342966_1782902657_n.jpg)

I'm not very good at picking out poisonous plant and venomous critters, but I knew enought to keep my distance and let him do his thing.  A ten minute wait for him to cross the trail was well worth not suffering a bite on the mountain top, especially when I was by myself. At any rate, I was prompted to look out for myself a little better and do some research.  Here are a couple quickies worth taking a peek at:

* [6 Most Dangerous Snakes in Georgia](http://www.gafollowers.com/6-dangerous-snakes-georgia/)

* [Venomous Spiders by State](http://www.venombyte.com/venom/spiders/venomous_spiders_by_state.asp)

Be safe, climb hard, and fly free!
