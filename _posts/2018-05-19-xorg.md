I ran into a quick little issue today and wanted to document the solution for myself.

After an upgrade and reboot, [SLiM](https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/SLiM) did not load correctly on it's usual TTY.  I manually logged in
via console and attempted `$ startx`.  I was met with an error about the xserver connection being refused.  This was confirmed in
`/var/log/Xorg.0.log`.

Thinking logically, I checked `~/.xinitrc` to see if there was anything wonky or misconfigured.  It was not (tested by commenting out
everything except window manager deployment).

Next, I checked if I had a video driver installed (not sure how that would slip through the cracks though!).

```
austin @T530 ~  pacman -Qe | grep intel
xf86-video-intel 1:2.99.917+831+ge7bfc906-1
```

Just as a litmus test I uninstalled the package and rebooted to see if the issue persisted.  It did.  So, I reinstalled the video driver and 
looked
in `/var/log/slim.log` for more information and found:

```
slim: waiting for X server to begin accepting connections
Giving up.
slim: unable to connect to X server
```

Thanks to some quick Googling (used smartphone) the quick fix I found was to `$ sudo rm /etc/X11/xorg.conf`.  Then reboot and things worked as 
normal.
