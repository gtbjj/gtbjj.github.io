I recently got a copy of [Controlled Aggression](https://www.amazon.com/Controlled-Aggression-Girard-Bradshaw/dp/B005D2SAQ6/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1548425622&sr=8-1&keywords=controlled+aggression) by [Jerry Bradshaw](https://www.instagram.com/tarheelk9/) which I'm very excited to start reading.  I've been a listener of the [Controlled Aggression Podcast](http://controlledaggressionpodcast.com/) since it started.  As I work my way through the book I'm going to make summary posts of different chapters as reminders to myself and hope they can be of use to others as well.

### Temperment Evaluation

In each section I've made notes of Jerry's *goals* for police / protection (sport) training.  In general, Jerry describes these evaluating these temperment traits somewhere between the age of **10 monts to 2.5 years** for **green dogs**.  Also, in general, **better sociability = better nerves** and **weaker nerves = less influence of drives on temperment**.  We'll get a closer look at this when I talk about my dog Dean at the end of the post.

The following temperment characteristics are covered:

- *Socialization*:  Interaction with people / animals in public (different than trainer / handler / owner relatoinship)
- *Nerves*:  Adaptability to change
- *Drives*:  Genetic motivators present in all dogs, but to differing degrees
- *Hardness*:  Resilience to adversity (or correction)
- *Focus*:  Relationship to traininer
- *Attention Span:*  Relationship to environment

**1) Public Sociability (not personal / pack sociability):**

- *social dog* = confident and forced greeting (though, sometimes to submit to dominant dog)
- *neutral dog* = "no fear is registered, and the dog simply ignores the stranger (to avoid conflict)", can be handler dependent or defensive
- *unsocial dog* = refuses to approach or allow anyone to approach

*Goal:  Social or (confident) Neutral*

**2) Nerves (Adaptability to Change):**

- *Fluid* (adaptability) = no hesitation and immediate acceptance of change
- *Studied* (adaptability) = initial concern, but able to investigate and confident enough to negotiate without lingering
- *Cautious* (adaptability) = dog adapts, but takes "shepherding" through changes by trainer
- *Incomplete* (adaptability) = dog is funcitonal in new environment, but never to same degree as familiar landscape
- *Halted* (adaptability) = dog is minimally funcitonal in new environment and never improves from this level
- *Accelerated* (adaptability) = dog who cannot function at all in new environment and shuts down despite trainer's efforts

*Goal:  Fluid or Studied adaptability*

**3) Drives:**

- *Prey* (hunting and retrieving) = desire to chase, catch, and / or kill
- *Social* (pack) = very imporant for (competitive) obedience; "willingness to please", tactile / verbal reward
- *Defense* (of prey, territory, self) = dogs with low defense threshold = poor candidate for compulsive training methods

**4) Hardness:**

- *Hard* = "dog can take a stout correction"
- *Soft* = "dog becomes upset or overly submissive after mild correction"

*Goal:  "...soft enough to respond properly to crrection, but not so hard that we will have to abandon positve punishment (all together)."*

**5) Focus and Attention Span:**

- *Outwardly-Focused* = "responds to distractions more than the attractions of the handler"
  - can result from low defense threshold (concerned with threats), lacking social skills, or very high prey drive
- *Inwardly-Focused* = dog is "unconcerned with environment" and "always looking to the trainer."
  - could be because of good socialization **or** over-dependenmce on handler
- *(low) Attention Span* = "usually referrs to younger dogs who may have a high capacity for attentiveness, but who are still experiencing their environment, and are distracted but will return focus."

*Goal: Inwardly-Focused, but not unablt to work independent of handler.*

Let's look at my 3 year old GSD / Malinois mix, Dean:

| Social.  | Nerves      | Drives           | Hardness | Focus / Attn. Span |
| -------- | ----------- | ---------------- | -------- | ------------------ |
| *Social* | Fluid       | Prey (high)      | *Soft*   | *Outward*          |
| Neutral  | *Studied*   | Social (medium)  | Hard     | Inward             |
| Unsocial | Cautious    | Defense (medium) |          |                    |
|          | Incomplete  |                  |          |                    |
|          | Halted      |                  |          |                    |
|          | Accelerated |                  |          |                    |

<br/>

- **Socialization:**  Dean is pretty chill in a **neutral** environment and around neutral dogs / people.  However, he is very (defensively) confident when provoked either through prey or defense.
- **Nerves:**  Dean's behavior is soemwhere between *Cautious* and *Fluid* adaptability.  At a minimum he is cautious of performing a task in a new environment or slight change in task, but with a little guidance to remind him what we're up to , it's business as usual.  I'd actually say his adaptability is pretty fluid and any hangups are related to drive and focus / attention span (below).
- **Drive:**  Dean is a bit of a prey monster.  He will chase and bite pretty much anything that you wave in front of his face, moves fast, or makes loud noises.  So his  prey drive is **high**.  I'd say his defense drive is **medium** since he is unusually quiet (for a shepherd) around the home and other people.  However, he is very defensive of himself and me against other dogs.  As for pack (social) drive, he definitely has a strong desire to  please, but only moderate response to tactile / rewards (not none, as food / toy rewards have become variable in our trianing).
- **Hardness:**  Dean is a rescue, and denfinitely had a lot of submissive reactiveness when I first picked him up about a year ago.  He was, and largely still is, a **soft** dog.  However, I have noticed that his *"hardness"* is highly dependent on his state of drive.  Chilling at home, a harsh word might cause him to slinking body posture.  On the other hand, if we're out for a walk and training off lease and a stray cat give chase and springs from under a car as we're passing by, it might take a very stout leach or e-collar correction to bring his attention back to me and he thinks nothing of it.
- **Focus and Attention Span:**  Dean is more outwardly focused (see above on drive and socialization), though it is not too difficult for me to recapture his attention depending on the level of distraction (e.g. a jug of rocks or can curtain at home vs. heeling through PetSmart during active cat adoptions; [video on Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/stories/highlights/18027998203060710/)).  Given Jerry's description of short attention span, this seems just the case for Dean.  He *is* more focused on the environment, but *can* be redirected to attentiveness with practice.  See also when I talked about Dean's "hardness."
