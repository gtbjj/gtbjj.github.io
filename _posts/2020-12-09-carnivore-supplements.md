By request, here's a discussion of the supplements I use on a carnivore diet.  Salt and electrolytes (spring water or drink mix) take priority for me, followed by organs that I may not have (regular or easy) access to.  "Uppers and downers" as I call them should be used with caution.  They both can have addictive / dependence issues.  I've talked about this with caffeine before, and have a queue of research to read regarding long term melatonin use.  The take home message should be, of course, that supplements are just that, a supplement to a whole foods, animal-based diet.  Oss!
