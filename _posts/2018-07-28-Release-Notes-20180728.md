#### Features:

**New / Fixed Features:**

- fingerprint sensor not being recognized by system (fully fixed)
- double tap power button to jump to camera (fully fixed)
- rebased and forked from [Franco Kernel](https://github.com/franciscofranco/angler)
- merging linux-stable (fixed, but already implemented by Franco Kernel)
- July 2018 security patch (learned to apply them myself so no need to wait for FK/Copperhead upstream to do so)
- franco features (not previously included):
  - disables verfied boot flag for Android Pay (root still breaks)
  - support for [FKUpdater App](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.franco.kernel)
  - support for FKUpdater performance profiles

#### News - Kernel Specific:

**Faux Audio Support:** Feature has been removed as the patch I used to implement it was breaking builds after I switched to Franco Kernel as a base.

**Fingerprint Scanner:**  The "patch" I was using to implement this improvement (increasing wakelock after interrupt) was based in a commit message (from Flash Kernel I believe), however, restoring the changed lines in ```drivers/input/fingerprint/fpc1020_tee.c```.

**CopperheadOS / Franco Kernel:**  The [previous repositories on GitHub](https://github.com/AndroidHardeningArchive/kernel_huawei_angler) have been renamed under a new organization (Android Hardening vs. CopperheadOS) and, for Angler, is now missing several  branches and the last commit is dated *September 26, 2017*.  There is [a new set of CopperheadOS repositories](https://github.com/CopperheadOS/kernel_huawei_angler) that an initial commit was pushed to for Angler in early July.  As Such I've rebased my kernel to [Francisco Fraco's Franco Kernel](https://github.com/franciscofranco/angler) as it is one of a shrinking number of kernels that are still actively maintained (as of June 2018) for the Nexus 6P.

**Linux Stable:**  Previously I was having issues where merging the [Android Linux Stable upstream from GitHub](https://github.com/android-linux-stable/angler) was breaking my builds.  However, I followed [android-linux-stable's instructions](https://github.com/android-linux-stable/notes/blob/master/process/how-to.md) to manually fetch / merge directly from the [Linux upstream](https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/stable/linux.git/).  I elected to use the *merge* rather than *cherry-pick* method.  Franco Kernel appeared to already be up to date with Linux 3.10.108.

**Security Patches:**  At the time of writing Franco Kernel has not yet been patched with the July security patch.  Fortunately, I learned to do this myself with the following steps:

- Check the [msm kernel branch tags](https://android.googlesource.com/kernel/msm/+refs) for the tag that has the most recent security patch.  For refernece, July 2018's patch tag is [android-8.1.0_r0.80](https://android.googlesource.com/kernel/msm/+/android-8.1.0_r0.80).
- The beginning of the tag's commit mesage with include A) the device name (angler) and the B) the build branch (e.g. OPM6.171019.030.E1).
- Check the [list of factory images](https://developers.google.com/android/images#angler) to see that the bulid branch matches the month's release you're looking for.  (e.g. '8.1.0 (OPM6.171019.030.E1, Jul 2018)')
- Use either the *cherry-pick* or *merge* methods mentioned in the [linux-stable guide](https://github.com/android-linux-stable/notes/blob/master/process/how-to.md).

#### News - Non-Kernel Specific:

**Jump to Camera:** I noticed a while back that, even on the stock ROM, double clicking the power button was not jumping to the camera -- which is one of my favorite features.  I first suspected that it was error / mismatching vendor.img, but it turns out that there is a hidden setting that is apparently off by default.  *Fix:*  Go to ```settings``` and search for ```jump to camera``` and enable.  Boomsy!

**Random Battery Shutdowns:**  I tried several solutions from around the web ([here](https://forum.xda-developers.com/nexus-6p/general/guide-fix-nexus-6p-bootloop-death-blod-t3640279) and [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/Nexus6P/comments/67y45a/yesterday_my_6p_shut_off_at_25_today_it_shut_off/dgudndw/)) that did not work.  [One proposed solution](https://www.reddit.com/r/Nexus6P/comments/681v42/early_shutdown_bug_temporary_fix/) to "recalibrate" the battery in conjunction with restoring to the latest stock factory images at least got me reliably below 50% when my device was dying sometimes as high as 60+%.  If you've been snooping around [my anykernel repo](https://github.com/savagesen/anykernel) since the last kernel release, I was experimenting with disabling the Big CPU cores as well as nerfing a bunch of other things to try and reduce the overall CPU load.  I've since done a hard reset on that repo as those profiles did not provide significant changes.

#### To-DO:

- I will run new performance benchmarks now for the old Battery v1.3 and Balance v1.2 spectrum profiles.
- The *zen* I/O Scheduler will be added.
- I will test some of the *minor* changes (animation scale and vibration strength) that were made to *nerfed* spectrum proiles mentioned above.
