By the end of October, Kobmat Kitchen will be 100 days old!  There's been a tremendous amount of growth and support since that time and I'm greatly appreciative of everyone who's been involved.

As Kombat Kitchen continues to grow at a rapid pace, things are going to continue to change and have to be adjusted to accommodate that growth.  As the expression goes, things break in multiples of 3:  going from 1 sponsor to 3, 3 employees to 10, 10 clients to 30, etc...

This all mean I have to closely monitor insights and analytics to find out where I can best spend my time / energy and make sure I'm delivering what people are interested in.  Sometimes that my swallowing my personal interest(s) for the sake of better business practices (afterall, my IG account does say I'm a business and not a person :D).

The [last newsletter]({% post_url 2020-08-22-Kombat-Kitchen-newsletter-20200822 %}) was all the way back in August.  Some highlights since then:

* We are now affiliated with three awesome companies (and I'm working on one more).
    * [Heart and Soil Supplements](https://heartandsoil.co) (10% off with code <code>savagezen10</code>)
    * [Tru Beef](http://trubeeftruorganicb.refr.cc/austinh) ($25 off your first order using [my referral link](http://trubeeftruorganicb.refr.cc/austinh))
    * [Submission Shark](https://submissionshark.com) (10% off with code <code>savagezen</code>)
    * all of which have already had at least one sale
* I have signed my first handful of clients.
* Website traffic is steadily increasing.
* Instagram followers have tripled and engagement is up over 50%.
* I have launched [a podcast](/tabs/kombat_kitchen/#freestuff) and recorded several interviews.
* I completed my [Precision Nutrition](https://www.precisionnutrition.com/certified-coach-directory) Level 1 certification.

So, there are lots of good things happening and a lot of momentum!  As physics tells us though, energy isn't created or destroyed, so the fuel for that momentum has to come from somewhere else.

As of 11/1 I'll be shutting down [the Kobmat Kitchen Telegram Group](https://t.me/kombatkitchen).  It has proven quite difficult to pull people from other platforms into the group and even harder to garner active engagement.

* I haven't lost sight of the importance of community however, so there will be a private group created on Instagram.  Most of us are on there already and that allows for easier / native content sharing and a collaborative atmosphere without an extra app.
* With that said, if you are still concerned about privacy, or want to contact me (for services over video / phone chat) on an encrypted medium, I do use [Signal Messenger](https://signal.org/download/) as well.  I hadn't chosen Signal to launch the group network because it is tied to your phone number (e.g. everyone else in the group would see your number rather than screen name).
