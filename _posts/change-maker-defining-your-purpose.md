**Question 1:**  *Why do you want to work in health and fitness in the first place?*

**Question 2:**  *Do you want to work with clients / patients?  If yes, what type of clients do you want to work with?  If no, what do you gravitate toward instead?*

**Question 3:**  *Do you really want to help other people?*

**Question 4:**  *Do you want to own or run a business?*

**Question 5:**  *What relationship do you want with your income?*

**Question 6:**  *What relationship do you want with your work?*

**Question 7:**  *What other skills, talents, and aptitudes do you have?*

**Bonus:**  *When you retire or die, how will you know whether you've followed your purpose?*


As I work my way through the [Change Maker](http://carnivorejiujitero.com/feed.xml) I'll be publicly posting the worksheets and discussion points.
