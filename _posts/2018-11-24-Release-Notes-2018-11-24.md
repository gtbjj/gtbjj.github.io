#### Kernel / Source Changes:

- readded maple i/o sched

- September security patch ([source](https://android.googlesource.com/kernel/msm/+/android-8.1.0_r0.101), [bulletin](https://source.android.com/security/bulletin/2018-09-01.html))
- October security patch ([source](https://android.googlesource.com/kernel/msm/+/android-8.1.0_r0.111), [bulletin](https://source.android.com/security/bulletin/2018-10-01.html))
- hima enabled by default, can be disabled in ```/sys/kernel/hima_hotplug```
- November security patch ([source](https://android.googlesource.com/kernel/msm/+/android-8.1.0_r0.116), [bulletin](https://source.android.com/security/bulletin/2018-11-01.html)):  I was thrown off by a typo in the commit message (in source) that dated the patch *October 2018.1*, however, the release nubmer (OPM7.181105.004) matches the [Factory Image](https://developers.google.com/android/ota#angler) number for November 5, 2018.
- Wake gestures are working, but tempermental on boot.  They can still be manually set via ADB or Kernel Auditor and work fine.

#### Installation Notes:

While ironing out several kinks over the last couple months, I've found the best practice for installing kernels to be:

- TWRP
- Wipe > Advanced Wipe > Dalvik / ART Cache and Cache
- Install > flash kernel
- Wipe > Advanced Wipe > Dalvik / ART Cache and Cache
- Reboot System
