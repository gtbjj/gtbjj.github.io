The firewall is one of the most basic components of your network security.  There are a lot of debates about Linux and security, but a firewall 
is a must regardless.  There are GUI tools available to help you do this (such as [Uncomplicated 
Firewall](https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Uncomplicated_Firewall)), but going a bit more minimal has its benefits.

For one, it is a bit more invovled, but as is usually the case with more "manual" and minimal implementations, you learn more about the 
process.  This is done through a program called [iptables](https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/iptables).  The [Arch Wiki section on Stateful 
Firewalls](https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/simple_stateful_firewall) is very detailed.  In addition to that, you can easily find a list of 
[the 25 most common iptable rules](http://www.thegeekstuff.com/2011/06/iptables-rules-examples/).

What can make this implementation painless is if you take the commands you issue (either through the 25 list or reading the wiki) and include 
them in a single script.

```
~/scripts/iptables.rules
---
# Simple Stateful Firewall

# Check current rules
#iptables-save

# Load Default Rules
#iptables-restore < /etc/iptables/empty.rules

# Create Chains
iptables -N TCP
iptables -N UDP

# etc...
```

Next, make the file executable:

```$ chmod u+x ~/scripts/iptables.rules```

Finally, create a shell alias in your ~/.{ba,z}shrc.  It 
will make sense here to fire up your network driver and 
deploy the firewall in one line like so:

```
~/.zshrc
---
alias wup="sudo wifi-menu; sudo ~/scripts/iptables.rules"
```
