*~ 10 years before present day*

In a heavily forested mountain area, Digoria Antica is bound and brought before a magistrage and an angry mob.  She is exiled from the town for treason and conspiracy against the magistrate.

Thus, she begins a journey towards the mountain top.  She sees smoke coming from somewhere high above and puruses it's roots.  Along the way she kills a wolf, but the 6 skeletons she encouters prove more troublesome.

A Paladin Elf, named Derek, comes to her aid.  Together the kill off the skeletons, two by Derek and 4 by Digoria.  Most notably, the final skeleton was killed by Digoria's *Ray of Frost* attack that propelled Derek's shield to decapitate the skeleton.

Derek and Digoria also kill a brown bear while continuing up the mountain.  They find a cabin, the source of the smoke, that is owned by an old looking mage who invites them in to stay the night.
