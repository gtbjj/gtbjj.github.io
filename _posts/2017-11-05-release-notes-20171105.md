#### Release Notes 2017-11-05

----

**dnd-tools**

[Pull Request 4](https://github.com/savagezen/dnd-tools/pull/4) was made earlier this week which offered several improvements including backwards compatibility with Python 2.  Previously Python 3.6+ was required due to the use of ```secrets()```.  [Pull Request 3](https://github.com/savagezen/dnd-tools/pull/3) implemented secrets, but the discussion in Pull Request 4 shows the conclusion that only the random tools embeded in ```secrets()``` were being used, rather than all of its functionality.

The merger of Pull Request 4 also bring the following fixes from [@Kronuz](https://github.com/Kronuz):
- PEP 8
- Added missing variable
- Correct misspellings
- Using random with system's PRNG if possible
- Package configuration setup in ```setup.py```

I made another push today that includes NPC classes in the character creation function.  Essentially this allows you to select from 35 NPC classes when building a charcter / NPC.  Creating an NPC is otherwise identical to creating a player character.  This is because "stock values" for standard NPCs are avaialble in many online bestiaries and in the Monster Manual.

Specific features *may* be added in the future, but it would take a large time commitment, though not too much difficulty to add the default stat blocks for each NPC class.

**rakudo-star / star-meta**

There have been many, many, many, many issues with getting Rakudo Star to build properly.  This has been most frustrating as both [rakudo](https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/rakudo/) and [rakudo-git](https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/rakudo-git/) have been building and installing fine.

[Discussions on the Rakudo Star AUR page](https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/rakudo-star/) and [discussed issues on GitHub](https://github.com/savagezen/pkgbuild/issues/2) have both lead to the suggestion of a meta-package.  Recent points made in the AUR discussion indicate that this is also the suggestion from upstream (since they seem to be neglecting the issue).

At any rate, fortunately a [zef package](https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/zef/) already exists in the AUR so making a meta package only required a post install script that used Zef to install the modules included in Rakudo Star ([listed here](https://github.com/rakudo/star/blob/master/modules/MODULES.txt)).

So, today marks the release of [star-meta](https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/star-meta/), a meta package that pulls down the additional Perl6 modules found in Rakudo Star.

The [rakudo-star](https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/rakudo-star/) package will continue to exist in the AUR and on [my GitHub page](https://github.com/savagezen/pkgbuild/tree/master/rakudo-star) for the time being, though they may be removed in the future.
