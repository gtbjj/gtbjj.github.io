#### Update 5/28/16:  This erorr has been patched as of pcutils-4.5.0-2

After upgrading to Linux Kernel 4.6-1 from the testing repo 
I was getting a boot error related to my root filesystem 
being formatted to F2FS.

The error thrown was pretty descriptive:

```
F2FS: Cannot load crc32 driver.
mount: no such file or directory.
```

Basically, the modules for F2Fs aren't loading so they need 
to be specified explicitly in */etc/mkinitcpio.conf*.  A 
quick Google search lead me to [a thread in the Arch Linux 
forums](https://bbs.archlinux.org/viewtopic.php?id=210673) 
that had a (for me) successful solution.

Simply modify the MODULES array in */etc/mkinitcpio.conf*.

```
MODULES="crc32 libcrc32c crc32c_generic crc32c-intel 
crc32-pclmul"
```

Then rebuild the kernel image via:

```
# mkinitcpio -p linux
```
