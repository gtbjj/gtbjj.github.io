Greetings everyone!

It has been a little over a month since I announced the start of Kombat Kitchen.  This is the big announcement that August 14, 2020 will be the official launch date!  Over the next week there will be lots of changes and developments, so if links or other medias break please be patient and don't hesitate to reach out.

So, over the course of the next week, the following changes will take place:

* The "Beta Testers" chat on Telegram will be open to the public.  This will is part of a revision to the White Belt program to be a more inclusive and welcoming community.
* Your access to exclusive content (on YouTube) won't change.  If you stay active on Telegram, you'll see the links when they're posted.
* The previous link to the White Belt e-book will be deactivated, but the revised version of the White Belt program will be available for download from the ["Shop" section of the website](/tabs/kombat_kitchen/#products).
* At the time of launch, at least the Blue Belt program will be available for sale.  The e-books will be in the $3 - $5 range and available as PDFs at first, and shortly after on [Google Play / Books](https://play.google.com/store/books).  Eventually they will be released on Amazon / Kindle as well.

Other News:

* At this time I have at least one affiliate, [Flyby](https://www.flyby.co/?rfsn=4562479.acaf32), who makes a great sugar free electrolyte powders / drinks.  I'm working on several other affiliates to bring you guys discount codes.  It's a great product that I've used for a while now.   Half the cost of Gatorade and 3x as potent.
* The website has been under heavy development.  There's a new ["Resources" section](/tabs/kombat_kitchen/#resources) with links to some of my favorite books and podcasts.
* T-Shirts are off the official site temporarily to avoid clutter.  If you're still interested in ordering one, let me know.
* I'm still trying to work out the details for a referral / rewards program so there's incentive for folks to stay engaged after a particular challenge is completed.
* Private coaching plans will be available as package deals (e.g. 5 sessions or 30 days, no week-by-week or session-by-session clients) down the road.
