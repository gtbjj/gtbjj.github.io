I was fortunate several months ago to be contacted by Submission Shark to be featured in one of their community interviews [original article](https://submissionshark.com/blogs/community/jiu-jitsu-austin-haedicke) regarding nutrition, mental health, and regenerative agriculture.  Of course, we "talked" a lot about my jiujitsu journey as well.  Submission Shark is one of the companies I'm very proud to be affiliated with for this very reason.  They are promoting and sharing the stories of "real", everyday jiujiteros/as -- rather than the latest headlines about celebrity and / or professional athletes.  They also run cool promotions from time to time like campaigning against domestic violence (#stoptheviolence).  Use the code 'savagezen' in their store and get 10% off!
