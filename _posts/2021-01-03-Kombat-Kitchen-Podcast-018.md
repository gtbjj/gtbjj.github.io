Rick and I have been friends for a long time and he's had an amazing health journey, gaining and losing 70 lbs over the last 10 years. In this episode we talk about animal-based nutrition (January is worldwide carnivore month by the way) and compromises for the sake of social and mental health. Fitting for the new year, we also talk about why most "resolutions" fail. Lastly, we spend a lot of time talking about law enforcement, abuse of power, and social justice campaigns. Rick is a bi-racial corrections officer in the Chicago area, so I'd like to think we keep things pretty well rounded and thinking critically about the circumstances we discuss.
