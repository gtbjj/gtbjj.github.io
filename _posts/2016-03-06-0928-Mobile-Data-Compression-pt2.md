### Comparing Data Compression Apps - Part II

<img style="float: right; height: auto; width: 40%" src="https://lh3.ggpht.com/XkKFmevjtyDntd5e0XeSssV1fukxNFuMvXRpMdXGZ56Ev5WPpggPrPFEi_2AUXFMbd4=w300-rw">

Continuing with second of three apps I'm testing to sess how they size up in saving you mobile data.   I test these apps for about a week at a 
time to compensate for daily variance in data usage.  You can [read Part One (featuring Opera Max) 
here](https://gtbjj.github.io/android/2016/03/03/Mobil-Data-Compression-pt1.html).  

Today's app is [Onavo](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.onavo.android.onavoics).  Onavo is very simple to set up and 
configure.  A plus for some, and a minus for others, it lacks the granular control that similar apps offer.  But, the purpose is to save you 
data, so let's see how things stack up.

### The Good:

Like most data compression apps, Onavo does great with things like Instagram.  As you can see, the savings were close to 40%.  Battery usage 
was slightly less than Opera Max (13% versus 18%).

### The Bad:

Onavo can notify you when it's not running, which you'll need because I found that it crashes about once every other day on my Nexus 6p.  
Secondly, I know that data compression / VPN services cannot compress encrypted data, but according to Onavo's reporting, the only thing it had 
an effect on was Instagram... *really?*

### The Ugly:

<img style="float: right; height: auto; width: 30%" src="http://drive.google.com/uc?export=view&id=0B2RH_BSaD6YPYXJBdkF2UmZNTGc">

Here is a screenshot of my  phone's reported data usage over the past few weeks.  As you can see **Onavo uses more data than it saves(!).**  
Even if you divide the number in the screenshot down to a daily figure, it still saps more background data than it save in daily usage.

### Verdict:

Not worth it.  The app is supposed to save you data and, in fact, costs you data.  Perhaps this is a sly maneuver by it's parent company, 
Facebook (**correction**: please read part three for more information on this data), to leech more personal data from folks.
