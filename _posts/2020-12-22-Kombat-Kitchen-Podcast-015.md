This was a fun one because Liam and I had never met before, yet through the wonders of social media our paths crossed due to similar interests in carnivorous diets, martial arts, and philosophy -- we'r both 32 as well! Liam is a health coach on MeatRx.com and is based out of El Paso , TX. Of course, we talked about our respective paths to carnivory, but we also talk about our mental health, family dynamics, and the evil maleficent people that exist in the world and developing self awareness and discipline through combat sports. We also talk about the importance of building a community staying connected to people in real life.  As usual we lighten the mood in the third segment with a lightning round and talk about the invigorating and often times overwhelming parts of starting a business.
