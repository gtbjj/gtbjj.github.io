One of the most insightful things I read prior to beginning life as a dirtbag was to not let climbing become a job for you, or to treat it like one rather.  The idea  being that if you feel like you ```have to climb``` every day simply because you can, then you're on the fast track to having all the love sucked out of it.

A few days ago I was headed "home" to [Rocktown](http://www.mountainproject.com/v/rocktown/106036120) / [Lost Wall](http://www.mountainproject.com/v/lost-wall/105900335) and stopped off at an exit for gas when I felt a drudging "Ugh!" in my mind when I felt I _*had to*_ go that way.  I gave in to the impulse desire of saying; ```"Screw it, I'm not any further from Chattanooga than I am from Rocktown.  What the hell is the point of being a dirtbag if you feel tied to any one place?!"```

So I logged some nice solo  morning sessions self-belaying at [Sunset Park](http://www.mountainproject.com/v/sunset-park/105888070).  I  must say, relaxing in the park in the downtown 'Nooga area across the river from the aquarium was a hell of a lot nicer way to spend the evenings than anything I might have done in LaFayette after a day of climbing.  ```Worth it!```

What's more is that I only ticked five climbs in three days.  Now, part of that is because this was a mid-week excursion and technically I do have a full-time job to attend to.  (However, the 2nd-ish shift schedule keeps my mornings pretty open).  There is just a different mindset that is learned with dirtbagging.  In weekend warrior mode you might try to pack as many climbs into a weekend as you possibly can, climb until your fingers fall off, and then spend Monday - Friday recovering or maybe logging a few hangboard sessions.

That attitude simply doesn't cut it dirtbagging for the reasons mentioned above.  Today I spent at much time setting up and rappelling as I did climbing and two or three times as much time hiking as I did climbing.  But the climb ([Stan's Carck Direct](http://www.mountainproject.com/v/stans-crack-direct-finish/105957468)) was excellent and I loved every minute of the morning.  If I was going to have to force myself to pack in more climbs simply "because I'm there" then it's not worth it and I need to take  a rest day to go sight seeing or some other shenanigans other than climbing.
