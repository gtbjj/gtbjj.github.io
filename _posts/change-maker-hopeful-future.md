### Survey Selling, Part 4: Analysis (bonus)

As my business is still in its infancy, the above was all written from speculation as I worked through that chapter in Change Maker.  Around the same time I ran a couple quick polls in my Instagram story just to do a validity check.  I asked:

* What do you use food for: Fuel or Fun?
* Don't confuse mass with strength.  If you had to pick: lose fat or build mass?
* Which matters more to you: performance or health?

This maybe took 15 minutes to post and returned invaluable insight.  Let's take a look:

* 90% of respondents said "fuel."  Good news.  I didn't expect many of them to have cultural / religious limitations to their dietary practices, but it's an important coaching consideration nonetheless.
* 66% of respondents preferred to lose fat over build mass.  As expected, a handful of people wanted to build mass, though I specified that mass was not the same as strength since I'm focusing on the nutritional component of things, not the weight room.
* 64% of respondents valued performance over health.  This is very important data.  Obviously both are good things, but when forced to make a choice, it's clear what my audience is asking for.

The snapshot of my audience then, looks like:

* no cultural / religious food restrictions,
* wants to lose fat, and
* improve performance.
