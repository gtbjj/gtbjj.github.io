It seems like Google is trying to phase out the personal library functionality of [the old Google Books](https://books.google.com/) in favor of 
[Google Play Books](https://play.google.com/books).  Now, Google Play Books is pretty nice.  However, if you're like me, then you uploaded a 
hoard of PDFs to the old module which was especially nice since it didn't count towards your Google Drive storage.

I found out recently that using [standard download 
instructions](https://www.google.com/webhp?sourceid=chrome-instant&ion=1&espv=2&ie=UTF-8#q=how%20to%20download%20play%20books%20offline), you 
can not download the old books (or even open them in some cases).  This was both frustrating and disapointing both for the mobile and desktop 
variants.

Fortunately, a bit of Googling landed me at the below link which worked like a charm.  You can archive all of your Play Book (or any / all of 
your Google account information) and have it emailed to you or added to an assortment of cloud storage services.  You can then download and 
unzip / untar the content.
