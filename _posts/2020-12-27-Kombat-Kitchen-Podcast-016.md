Using my experience in 2021 as a template, I review the "Reputation" chapter of the Change Maker book (by John Berardi). In short, build "unimpeachable" credentials, do awesome work, and build relationships. There will be a follow up reflection episode (as cliche as it is at the end of the year), featuring a year long challenge for 2021.
