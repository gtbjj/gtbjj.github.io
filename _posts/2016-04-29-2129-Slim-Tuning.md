A short post here to highlight some of 
[SLiM](https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/SLiM)'s 
configuration options.  SLiM is a lightweight and easily 
customizable display manager.  It's responsible for 
starting the *x window* environment on login.  ([More about 
display managers](https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Display_manager))

*Quick Note*:  The Arch Wiki gives a warning about SLiM's compatibility 
with *systemd*.  However, I've never had an issue that was directly 
related to SLiM.

The config file in qustion is: ```/etc/slim.conf```.  The 
configuration file has pretty good descriptions of the 
options, so I'll just go over some of my favorites here.

- numlock

> This is a simple option that you'll probably want so that you don't hvae 
to manually do it either for login password entry or during regular use.

- default_user

> This will save a second or two of not having to manually enter your 
username at login.  Relevant if you have a single user system.

- current_theme

> The default theme is pretyt hideous in my opinion, 
so... The 
[archlinux-themes-slim](https://www.archlinux.org/packages/extra/any/archlinux-themes-slim) 
package contains several clean good looking themes.  After 
installing the package, the themes are stored in 
```/usr/share/slim/themes```.  Set the *current_theme* 
option to the theme's name listed in the above directory.

- auto_login

> This is a convenient option for single user systems who 
might [encrypt an entire 
system](https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Dm-crypt/Encrypting_an_entire_system).  
You wouldn't want this if you're only encrypting */home* 
(because what's the point then) or if there are multiple users on the system.

- login_command

> Given your circumstances, you may want to have a certain 
program or shell script run upon login.  This is where you 
would enter that.
