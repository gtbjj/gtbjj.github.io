Finally!  [#kombatkitchen](/tabs/kombat_kitchen) has launched.  It's a special date for me because I'm celebrating 5 months as a carnivore!  Carnivory doesn't have anything to do with Kombat Kitchen (not directly anyway) and is in no way implied -- I just thought the synchronicity was nice.

I've released [a series of short videos](/tabs/kombat_kitchen) describing in more detail what exactly Kombat Kitchen is as well as the philosophies and principles that founded and continue to drive it.

I will be adding to the series with FAQs so you can get all your "about" and "FAQ" information in the same place!  You don't have to scour different sites or playlists.   If you have any questions at, please don't hesitate to [send me a message on Telegram](https://t.me/savagezen), [Instagram](https://instagram.com/savagezen), or on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/carnivorebjj).
