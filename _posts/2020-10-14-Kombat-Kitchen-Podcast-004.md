Tex and I have been friends for more than half our lives. He has worked and lived on a farm his entire life which brings a unique perspective when discussing animal ethics, potential limitations of regenerative agriculture, and hunting / conservation ethics. Tex's own health journey encompasses gaining and losing about 100 lbs over the last 10 - 15 years and we talk about performance versus sustainable physique. We also get metaphysical early on talking about virtue signaling and death anxiety. Alas, there's some levity at the end with a lightning round.
