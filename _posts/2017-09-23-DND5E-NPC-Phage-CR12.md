**Abilities**

***Regeneration.*** The vampire regains 10 hit points at the start of its turn if it has at least 1 hit point and isn’t in sunlight or running water. If the vampire takes radiant damage or damage from holy water, this trait doesn’t function at the start of the vampire’s next turn.

***Spider Climb.*** The vampire can climb difficult surfaces, including upside down on ceilings, without needing to make an ability check.

***Vampire Weakness.*** The vampire has the following flaws: Forbiddance. The vampire can’t enter a residence without an invitation from one of the occupants. Harmed by Running Water. The vampire takes 20 acid damage when it ends its turn in running water. Stake to the Heart. The vampire is destroyed if a piercing weapon made of wood is driven into its heart while it is incapacitated in its resting place. Sunlight Hypersensitivity. The vampire takes 20 radiant damage when it starts its turn in sunlight. While in sunlight, it has disadvantage on attack rolls and ability checks.

***Etherealness:***  Phage magically enters the Ehtereal Plan from the Material Plane, or vice versa.  To do so, she must have a heartstone in her posession.  (This was given to her by her mother, a night hag.)

***Spellcasting:***  Phage's spellcasting ability comes through worship of the occult.  Her spellcasting ability is Charisma (save DC 12, +4 to hit).  She has the following sorcerer spells prepared:

- *Cantrips (at will)*:  Blade Ward
- *1st level (4 slots)*:  Sheild
- *2nd level (3 slots)*:  Hold Person, Darkness

**Actions**

***Multiattack.*** The vampire makes two attacks, only one of which can be a bite attack.

***Claws.*** Melee Weapon Attack: +7 to hit, reach 5 ft., one creature. Hit: 9 (2d4 + 4) slashing damage. Instead of dealing damage, the vampire can grapple the target (escape DC 13).

***Bite.*** Melee Weapon Attack: +7 to hit, reach 5 ft., one willing creature, or a creature that is grappled by the vampire, incapacitated, or restrained. Hit: 7 (1d6 + 4) piercing damage plus 7 (2d6) necrotic damage. The target’s hit point maximum is reduced by an amount equal to the necrotic damage taken, and the vampire regains hit points equal to that amount. The reduction lasts until the target finishes a long rest. The target dies if this effect reduces its hit point maximum to 0.

#### History & Personality

Ruthless, relentless, bloodthirsty, and unpredictable.  Imagine if Sabertooth and Harley Quinn had a child.  Physical appearance (above image) credit to MTG's "Phage the Untouchable."

Phage tends to bring out the worst in [Digoria]({% post_url 2017-04-23-DND5E-Profile-Digoria %}), specifically, she seems to enable Digoria's bloodlust and *dark side.*  Though their relationship is quite incidious, not unlike Wolverine and Sabertooth, they've worked together in the past as well as had heated battles.

Phage was allegely born from a Vampire Spellcaster and has stated that she was gifted a hearthstone by her mother (a night hag).  At some point, Phage came into allegiance with [Ellion Stryfe]() who, among being powerful and evil, told Phage that her father had sought out [The Master Sword]() in the Kokiri Forest.  However, neither the sword or the vampire could be retrieved and the two pillaged the sacred forest.  This was the first of many rampages and ransackings that Phage conducted for Ellion as well as for her own sadistic satisfaction.
