#### Kernel / Source Changes:

**Oreo 8.1.0:**

- CopperheadOS / [Clang](https://github.com/CopperheadOS/platform_prebuilts_clang_host_linux-x86) - compiled with Linaro and Copperhead's hardened clang.  Once upon a time I used CopperheadOS as a base kernel before development slowed.  At any rate, Pixel devices are compiled with Clang, so I went ahead and used Copphead's version for this kernel as well.  See [Copperhead's official documentation](https://copperhead.co/android/docs/technical_overview#compiler-hardening)
- CopperheadOS - hardened ```.config``` changes.  See [this commit](https://github.com/CopperheadOS/kernel_huawei_angler/commit/ed07138b5295e1caad9b2f3240aadfe08132327e)
- CopperheadOS / SLUB sanitization, [cherry-picked commit](https://github.com/CopperheadOS/kernel_huawei_angler/commit/d7d6ff18583bd8c74017a283adfb8994a3cc4432)
- CopperheadOS / add FORTIFY_SOURCE measures, [CopperheadOS kernel hardening](https://copperhead.co/android/docs/technical_overview#kernel-hardening)
- CopperheadOS / gather extra entropy at boot - [cherry-picked commit](0ccf3172e7409062340d14d9821caf7709501046))
- CopperheadOS / port grsecurity's device side channel, [cherry-pick commit](https://github.com/CopperheadOS/kernel_huawei_angler/commit/1714e7fc9a2abe2e9a76fc1dd28abd1b2a4246da)
- [December 2018 Security Patch](https://android.googlesource.com/kernel/msm/+/android-8.1.0_r0.121)
- testing build 20181211-01

**Pie 9.0:**

After checkin with some other developers.  The Oreo version *should* be compatible with Android 9.0 Pie.  There are a couple things I'm tyring to work in to ensure that this is the case such as:  setting SELinux as permissive ([see potential patch by AdrianDC](https://github.com/AdrianDC/kernel_permissive_patcher/blob/master/kernel_permissive_patcher/kernel_permissive.sh)), double checking that safety net is off and dm-verity is off.

- Testing builds removed to rebase from latest Oreo build
- Will focus on pie once oreo security releases stop
- the sources are still open if someone can tell me what to patch in order to be compatible with Pie
- development versions:  20181211-{02,03,04}:  testing permissive selinux (anykernel)

Again, if there are any issues, please reach out on [the kernel's Telegram channel](https://telegram.me/sz_kernel_angler).  For future plans (by request) I'll look into file based encryption (FBE) and BBS and EIS.  Of course, any security patches that we continue to recieve will be included as well.
