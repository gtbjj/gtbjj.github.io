Put in 4 Categories:

* Unique Abilities = skill and passion (awesome and love it): **1,285 minutes**
    *  Dog  Play / Train x 110
    *  Social Media Create Content / Scheduling x 325
    *  Meditation x 20
    *  Play / Gun / Bow x 75
    *  Reading x 140
    *  Journaling x 120
    *  BJJ / Training x 210
    *  Poscast x 285
* Competent Activities = minimum standard w/o passion (awesome but don't love it): **470 minutes**
    * Hygiene x 90
    * Meal / Prep x 135
    * BJJ / Film x 90
    * Answer Messages x 95
    * House cleaning x 60
* Excellent Activities = capable, but gives you some anxiety: **557 minutes**
    * Social Media Browsing x 207
    * Website / Online Marketing x 155
    * Online Dating x 20
    * Analytics / Goal Planning / Systems x 175
* Incompetent Activities = you hate it and it stresses you out : **210 minutes**
    * In-Person Marketing x 180
    * Grocery Shopping x 30

*Summary:*  From a self satisfaction standpiont that looks like a pretty good ratio.  Therea re some thigns you hate and that stress you out that you're still going to have to do.  Fortunately, that was what I spent the least time doing.  In contrast, I spent, by far, the majority of my time doing things that I love and find fulfilling (#winningatlife).  Then, in the middle, things I do to a minimum standar (without passion) and that I'm capable of but give me some anxiety were about even.  The punch line is this ```the time spent on "unique abilities" was more (barely) than the other three categories combined.``  That seems to be the catalyst  for a thriving life.  But, what about a thriving business..... (below)

Low-Leverage Activities I Worked On: **1,122 minutes**

* Dog  Play / Train x 110
* Hygiene x 90
* Meal / Prep x 135
* Social Media Browsing x 207
* Meditation x 20
* Play / Gun / Bow x 75
* Grocery Shopping x 30
* BJJ / Film x 90
* Online Dating x 20
* Poscast x 285
* House cleaning x 60

High-Leverage Activities I Worked On: **1,400 minutes**

* Social Media Create Content / Scheduling x 325
* Website / Online Marketing x 155
* In-Person Marketing x 180
* Reading x 140
* Journaling x 120
* BJJ / Training x 210
* Answer Messages x 95
* Analytics / Goal Planning / Systems x 175

High-Leverage Activities I Didn't Work On:

* N/A

*Summary:*  More good news here!  I spent more time on high-leverage activities than low leverage activities.  Obvisouly some low-leveage things like house cleaning and hygeine will always be necessary; as will the things like meditating and playing because if you don't have a thriving life (part 1), then you won't have the energy to produce a thriving business.  Things like reading and journaling got included in the high-leverage group because most of my reading and journaling is based around business development as of late.
